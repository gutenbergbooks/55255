<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> ideal hunter, like the ideal soldier or
mountaineer, seaman or worker of any
kind, “leaves nothing to chance”; yet in anticipating
events he realises the limits of human
foresight and remains continually wide-awake.
Wellington has quoted Marshal Wrede’s report
of Napoleon’s way of doing—to do from day to
day what the circumstances require, but never
have any general plan of campaign. That was
how to rule circumstances by obeying them, as
a seaman steering through the storm may be said
to rule the waves. There are some occupations
that allow more room for somnolence than others.
Like the seaman afloat and the soldier in war,
the man who is hunting big cats can ill afford to
be caught napping. The consequences are apt
<a name="pg_2" id="pg_2" href="#pg_2"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>2<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to be sudden. It is a terrible thing to wake up
from a nap with nothing to do but die.</p>

<p>Whether you are hunting thieves or tigers, you
proceed by good guessing based on knowledge.
There is no real difference between what is
pompously called scientific reasoning and plain
common-sense, as Huxley has elaborately shown.
Thieves and tigers have their habits, like all
living things, and need to eat to live. One of
the commonest successful ways of coming to close
quarters with “Mr Stripes” is to go to where he
has been killing lately, and lie in ambush. If you
persevere in doing that in the usual way, you
are sure to meet the tiger in the long run; and
perhaps, as happened to this writer in Burma,
you may enjoy the pleasure of making his
acquaintance with startling suddenness the very
first time you try. So it is well to be ready for
anything, lest you have a disagreeable experience,
like three men in the Assam forests, whose
adventure is worth telling, as a warning to beginners.
The present writer heard it from Major Shaw
(6th Gurkhas), in whom he has complete confidence.
Of course it was in Assam that Major
Shaw heard of it. For obvious reasons, no other
names than his are given; and no superfluous
details.</p>

<p><a name="pg_3" id="pg_3" href="#pg_3"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>3<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>There is a public rest-house in the Assam woods,
which was visited by a hungry tiger not many
years ago. The caretaker (or “dirwan”) was
there at the time, but nobody else. The tiger
took him away, and ate him.</p>

<p>Exactly how it was done remained unknown,
as is usual in such cases. The men who are eaten
by beasts of prey are generally like the crews of
ships that never arrive, but remain for ever “missing.”
Not once in a thousand times can even the
bones be found, and nothing was discovered in
this instance, but nobody doubted what had
happened. Nevertheless, a successor was soon
installed in the dead man’s place. The tiger
called again; and once more the post became
vacant, and a public servant was mysteriously
“missing.”</p>

<p>The caretaker of a rest-house, like the humble
postman, is one of the few officials who appear to
the non-official world to justify their existence.
If it had been a forester or a policeman, a judge
or a soldier, people would have shrugged their
shoulders and said, “So much the worse for
him.” In the glad excitement of filling the
vacancy, his colleagues would have forgotten him,
and only his relatives, perhaps, if they had cause,
lamented. But the caretakers of rest-houses are
<a name="pg_4" id="pg_4" href="#pg_4"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>not luxuries but necessaries; and when either a
second or a third man (Major Shaw could not
recollect whether three caretakers or only two)
had in this way disappeared into the hideous
darkness that dimly veiled a hungry tiger,
and there was a likelihood that travellers
might be inconvenienced by the post remaining
vacant, three men of public spirit arose and took
their rifles, and went together to spend a night in
the tiger-haunted bungalow, and give Mr Stripes
a warm reception when he next came to call.</p>

<p>The oddest detail in the account of their
preparations is that they fixed bayonets. The
veranda was level with the floor of the building,
apparently, and not far above the ground. It was
reached from outside by a flight of steps, and ran
along the front, with the doors of the rooms opening
upon it. That was where the three men
placed themselves, when they had finished dinner
and arranged everything, fixed bayonets and all.
They closed the doors, and supposed they were
invisible, for the gleam of the lamplight was then
restricted to the back and the side-windows. In
front was only darkness visible. As they lay in
wait there, the one in the middle would be where
the caretaker was accustomed to lie, opposite the
top of the stairs.</p>

<p><a name="pg_5" id="pg_5" href="#pg_5"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>5<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>It must be remembered that the men perhaps
expected to have to sit up several nights. They
soon found what they had not expected, that
it is very hard to keep awake, especially in a
horizontal position, at the hour when you are
usually asleep. Experienced hunters would have
taken turns to lie in the middle wide-awake, and
let the other men, on right and left, be at liberty
to snooze. But these three men had been too
excited to apprehend in advance the possibility
of closing their eyes while waiting. They
conversed in low whispers, and peered into the
dark. Instead of coffee to keep them awake, as
the night wore on, they drank whisky-and-soda.</p>

<p>The sound of a tropical forest is like London’s
noise, which never altogether stops, but what
reached their ears was unexciting. The quadrupeds
a-hunting were unseen, and flitted about as
noiselessly as the clouds.</p>

<p>The three men slept. The man in the middle
was suddenly jerked to his feet by the tight
clasp of the tiger’s jaws upon his forearm; and
he staggered as it led him away, as if he had
been a child. He was out of reach of his rifle
before he was sufficiently awake to realise what
was happening. It was afterwards conjectured
that the tiger had been waiting below, and listening
<a name="pg_6" id="pg_6" href="#pg_6"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to their whispering, till the change of noises
indicated sleep.</p>

<p>While the tiger, taking its man by the arm,
was stepping downstairs, the man was thinking
only, “I hope the bullet won’t hit me.” He
never doubted that one of his companions was
preparing to fire. But the other two men,
awakened, and aware that the tiger had come,
had taken refuge in a room, and supposed that
he had done the same.</p>

<p>There was nothing very remarkable in the tiger
pulling away the man in this way. That was
probably how he had treated the caretakers. In
their many millenniums of battle with mankind,
and civilised mankind, not ill-armed negroes,
such as make the lions bold, the tigers of the old
world seem to have learned that the arms are
the dangerous members of a man, like the poison
fangs of a serpent, so that to seize them is to
master him. There are many cases of a man
being saved alive from a tiger by other men,
when it was pulling him away by the arm; but
I have never heard of any man so situated being
able to deliver himself. In general, of course,
it is easier to break a man’s neck at once; but
if you were a tiger, and your man were on a
veranda, and had to be brought downstairs to
<a name="pg_7" id="pg_7" href="#pg_7"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>7<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be eaten comfortably, could you think of a better
way than to pull him by the arm, and make
him descend the stairs on his own legs? The
tiger is a specialist in killing, and knows its
business. It is not killing men that bothers
the tiger, but catching them unawares.</p>

<p>So the tiger and the man together reached
the bottom of the stairs without anything
happening, and thence the tiger led towards the
adjoining forest; but on the way the victim
turned his face to the house as well as he could,
and cried: “Are you fellows not going to help
me?”</p>

<p>This was the first intimation of his fate to the
other two. One of them came out and ran
after the retreating figures of the tiger and the
man disappearing down the pathway, going
towards the woods, and overtook them in the
nick of time. The shout had somehow affected
the tiger too. He opened his jaws, and the
mangled arm fell free; but a great paw was on
the man’s shoulder; and on the other shoulder
another paw was now deliberately laid, and the
tiger breathed in his face a deep, long exhalation—warm
breath of a peculiar odour, that seemed
to penetrate him.</p>

<p>Just then the pursuer arrived, and thrust his
<a name="pg_8" id="pg_8" href="#pg_8"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bayonet between the tiger’s ribs, and pushed it
in, and pulled the trigger. Then leaving the
rifle there, feeling instinctively what Dr Johnson
noticed in himself with surprise, when travelling
in the Highlands, how willingly, in the dark,
a man becomes “content to leave behind him
everything but himself,” he shouted “Follow
me!” and ran back into the bungalow. The
startled tiger had indeed let go its prey for the
moment, but, seeing him run after the other man,
it followed both; and, bounding up the stairs
once more, it overtook at the top the man with
the mangled arm, but only in time to give him a
“smack on the back,” which sent him flying
through the doorway into the room where the
others were. Then it died.</p>

<p>They washed the badly-bitten arm with whisky,
having no medicaments of any kind. It would
have been strange if they had had any, for men
are so seldom hurt in tiger-shooting that nobody
anticipates injury. They had nothing but whisky.
So they poured it on, and “it nipped,” at any-rate,
which was, somehow, a comfort.</p>

<p>When the wounded man beheld himself in the
looking-glass in the morning, he saw that his
hair had suddenly grown grey in that one night.
The third man, it is said, was delirious, with shame
<a name="pg_9" id="pg_9" href="#pg_9"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>9<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and remorse, because he had faltered. Meanwhile
the tiger, growing stiff, lay dead on the veranda,
just outside the door of the room, with a gaping
wound in its side, like Thorwaldsen’s lion at
Lucerne.</p>

<p>When Major Shaw saw the injured man he
had quite recovered. There was a scar on the
arm, and a stiffness in two of the fingers, nothing
else; but “for the rest of my life I could smell
a tiger at fifty yards,” said he. “I’ll never
forget the smell that went through me as he
breathed upon me—never, as long as I live.”</p>

 />THE WONDERFUL ESCAPE OF “TIGER-HILL”</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">I am</span> sorry to say it is more than twenty years
since I began to listen to stories of tigers
and leopards in Burma; and even more since
I first made acquaintance with the beasts myself.
I do not expect to see any more now,
except in a Zoo. So perhaps it is time to
note what has been learned, to re-tell the best
of what I have heard, and in short do for others
what others in days gone by have done for
me. I have always considered that the man
who keeps a good story fresh is the greatest of
public benefactors.</p>

<p>What made me think of this in connection
with cats was the recent discovery of the truth
of a story, which I have heard many times
without believing it. It was first told to me in 1891
by Burmans in the locality where it happened.
Then, and as often afterwards as it was told, I
questioned the speaker about how he knew, and
never was quite satisfied. Even the version of
<a name="pg_11" id="pg_11" href="#pg_11"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it in Colonel Pollok’s <cite>Wild Sports of Burma and
Assam</cite> (p. 65 of the 1900 edition), read like
hearsay and seemed unconvincing. At last, in 1908,
Colonel Dobbs told it to me in Coonoor, and
when he was questioned he was able to delight
me with the news that he had <em>seen</em> the thing. So
here it is.</p>

<p>The time was 1859. The scene was the forest-covered
hilly ground about seventy miles north
of Maulmain, in what is now Bilin township of
Thaton district, Burma, between the Sittang and
Salween rivers. A detachment of the 32nd
Madras Native Infantry, under Captain Manley,
was marching on business there, going in single
file along a footpath, preceded by the civil officer
with them, a Mr Charles Hill.</p>

<p>Hill was a big man, “over six feet and of great
strength,” and strode ahead with a big stick in
his hand, while two orderlies or servants followed
at a careless distance behind him, with his weapons.
This Chinese way of making war or hunting is
almost a custom in Burma among Europeans; and
a very natural custom too, in a hot, moist climate.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hill came upon a tiger lying full
length on the footpath, apparently asleep. He
looked round and called for his gun. It was for
the moment out of reach.</p>

<p><a name="pg_12" id="pg_12" href="#pg_12"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Perhaps it may be worth while to try to make
the ordinary stay-at-home Englishman, who does
not know how lucky he is to be able to stay at
home, and knows a great deal less than he
supposes, realise how and why the sensations of Mr
Hill were different from what his own would
have been. The first point is that Hill knew
what a Londoner would never suspect, that there
was no particular cause to be afraid. If afraid,
he had only to go back a few yards, and shout, and
bang the trees with his stick. The monstrous cat
would take the hint and silently slip away. Not even
a tiger in the prime of life would <em>seek</em> a fight. He
feels, what politicians are only beginning to realise
in another sphere, that fighting is bad business.</p>

<p>We must remember that the tiger has no
medicaments, no surgical help, no hospitals, no
friends, no companions. When he crawls away to
lick his wounds, he is as solitary in a hostile world
as a poor man “out of a job,” on a wet wintry
night on the Thames Embankment, and suffers and
dies unaided and alone. This is not conducive to
courage. So even a tiger that has taken to eating
men does not openly attack humanity, but lies
in wait for it, to take it by surprise without
fighting, seeking nothing but to get his dinner
in the easiest way. Our common criminals, and

 </span></span></a>many wholesale thieves of superficial respectability,
are more dangerous than tigers because of their
extra cunning, but not different in spirit. What
difference there is, is in favour of the tiger. He
is never malevolent or cruel. Like Jonathan Wild,
he never hurts anybody, except to benefit himself.</p>

<p>The Englishman at home will perhaps now be
ready to understand the next point that will
surprise him, that the retiring habits of the tiger
make him a rare sight, even in countries where he
is at home. I have known many people who had
often suffered from the depredations of tigers, but
had never seen one, just as a man’s house may be
burgled more than once without his seeing any of
the burglars. The tiger is like a burglar, who
comes and goes in the dark.</p>

<p>It is true that a globe-trotter visiting Rangoon
to-day (1909) may buy on the Pagoda steps a picture
of a tiger upon the Pagoda, and be truly told that it
was seen there. Some years ago a tiger did go
up the gentle slope of the spire; and once arrived
there, he stood bewildered, as if paralysed;
conspicuous, like a weather-cock upon a steeple, looking
helplessly down upon a large port like Plymouth,
a big animated and terrified target, while
the soldiers shot at him till they killed him. But
though Englishmen, who knew there were tigers
<a name="pg_14" id="pg_14" href="#pg_14"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>always near, might think this natural, and only
wonder that it did not happen oftener, and wish it
would, yet to the people of the country, who knew
the habits of tigers, it seemed portentous. Long
afterwards old men might be seen on the Pagoda
platform shaking their heads knowingly, and if
you listened and understood them, you could hear
them discussing what the miracle meant. It was
certainly very odd. The poor animal must somehow
have lost his reckoning. To use an old-fashioned
phrase, he was never intended for a town life,
and assuredly he never intended to try it. The
Pagoda stands on the skirts of the town, on the
last bluff of the Pegu hills, and he was probably
going up it before he knew he had left the woods.</p>

<p>An incident that took place near the scene of
Mr Hill’s adventure may be mentioned to illustrate
the normal ways of the tiger. Three officers
united to assist the villagers there against a tiger
that was thinning their herds. Each of them had
killed big cats before; and one was locally famous as
a hunter. His house was full of trophies, including
scores of tiger skins, of which he was as proud as
ever Red Indian was of scalps. About a hundred
villagers who knew the ground well co-operated
zealously. No mistakes were made, and everybody
did his best for several days; and yet not one of
<a name="pg_15" id="pg_15" href="#pg_15"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the large party ever even saw the beast they were
seeking. He had not gone away. He was lying
low; and he resumed his cattle killing as soon as
they stopped hunting. The widest “beat” in woods
like these is like a net flung at random into the
sea. A hunter is lucky if he averages a single
glimpse of such game for half-a-dozen days or
nights out of bed. Experienced hunters seldom go
out there after tiger except to spend a night in a tree
over a “kill,” which is generally a bullock killed
and left half eaten, to which the tiger may return.</p>

<p>So it is easy to understand why Hill was
unwilling to lose sight of this fellow, especially if
Colonel Pollok is rightly informed that it was a
man-eater; for in that part of Burma the occasional
man-eater is not only a public affliction, he is also
more often than not old and decrepit. I saw one in
the Sittang valley, which had killed three men in one
week, and yet was a meagre creature, with shrunken
shanks and bald, bare hide, which made him look
mangy, and with only a single whole tooth in his
jaws, and two broken ones. So if Hill had heard
the rumour which Colonel Pollok believed and took
this for a man-eater, he might reasonably suppose
he could take liberties. The canny Dutch themselves
have a proverb, that the hares can pull the
lion’s beard when the lion has grown old.</p>

<p><a name="pg_16" id="pg_16" href="#pg_16"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>It is a witty exaggeration, of course, as proverbs
often are. In reality, neither hares nor horses nor
deer of any kind would risk going near a lion or a
tiger, however old. They shrink in horror from
the like of a tiger. I have felt a brave horse
shudder at one although he was dead, for even
in death he seemed terrible. But his carcass does
not cumber long the ground. White ants have a
horror of nothing, and maggots and microbes,
safe in their insignificance, are equally impartial.
Vultures, too, may serve the tiger for undertakers,
as they serve the Parsis, or the wild dogs may
anticipate them. Sometimes it has been credibly
reported that the dogs begin the tiger’s
funeral before he is dead, so that if only the Dutch
had said “dogs” instead of “hares” their proverb
would have been <em>not</em> wit but natural history.</p>

<p>Even if Hill had never heard about this tiger
being a stiff old man-eater, he might have
suspected it was one, because it was there, upon the
footpath, as if it had fallen asleep while watching
for some benighted traveller who might be caught
unawares. The few seconds Hill stood waiting
for a gun would seem as many minutes, or more.
In short, it is easy to imagine how, as he watched
the big beast, perhaps stretching itself and yawning,
seeming likely to step aside soon, before a gun
<a name="pg_17" id="pg_17" href="#pg_17"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>arrived, into a wood wherein a few steps would
make it safe from pursuit, the big strong man lost
patience, and lifting his stick with both hands he
hit the tiger on the head between the eyes.</p>

<p>This completed the wakening process. Hill
said he only saw it disappear among the bushes
at the side of the path. Meanwhile Lieutenant
Dobbs (he was <em>young</em> Dobbs then and on duty
under Captain Manley) happened to be nearest
to the front after Hill, and he and some sepoys
hurried forward. In jungle fighting you run to
the shouting, just as in ordinary war the rule used
to be to march towards the sound of the cannon.
So Dobbs, running forward in this way, was in
time to see what followed. It was all over in a
few seconds, and the reproaches of the troops in
some histories of the event are without foundation.
The tiger leapt out of the bush towards Hill’s
back, and with a paw on each of his shoulders
was seen to be biting at the back of his neck, as
if trying to get a grip. Then Hill, who had been
flung forward into a stooping posture, but kept his
foothold, straightened himself with a jerk, whirled
round and thrust out his arms in front of him, with
open palms, as if pushing. “That, at least, is
what it seemed like to me,” said the accurate
veteran, Colonel Dobbs, and that was how Hill
<a name="pg_18" id="pg_18" href="#pg_18"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>described it. Then the tiger fell backwards,
rolled on his back, regained his balance with a soft,
silent celerity, and disappeared again among the
bushes “almost like lightning,” and was seen no
more.</p>

<p>Hill came staggering towards Dobbs, and fell
on his face in a dead faint. He was bleeding
freely from the neck, but the bleeding was soon
stopped. “Only the upper fangs penetrated the
neck,” writes Colonel Pollok. What Dobbs was
sure of was only that in a short time Hill was
going about as usual, “though he complained of
stiff neck for about two years afterwards.”</p>

<p>In 1891 the Burmans thereabouts were still
speaking of him as “Kya-ma-naing,” meaning
“The man that the tiger did not beat.” He was
honourably known to his countrymen in Burma
for the rest of his life as “Tiger-Hill”; and the
many and various versions of his adventure might
furnish texts for a book on mythology as long as
Fraser’s three big volumes on the <cite>Golden Bough</cite>.
But as nearly all the reflections hitherto made
upon it are refuted by this mere statement of the
details, the present writer will take warning from
the mistakes of his predecessors and leave readers,
now in possession of the truth, to evolve their own
reflections.</p>

 />SHERLOCK HOLMES IN A WOOD</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">On</span> 20th April 1895, being engaged in Forest
Settlement work among the low hills abutting
on the south the mountain barrier between
Burma and Assam, I was aroused, as I sat reading
in a tent in the afternoon, by a signal. It meant
that my colleague, Mr Bruce, the Deputy
Conservator of Forests, who had gone out to shoot
pigeons for dinner, either was or expected soon to
be in contact with tiger, and wished me to join
him—which I did, at a run. He was near the
camp. The tigers thereabouts are more plentiful
than elsewhere in Burma. We had seen and heard
abundant evidence of their proximity for weeks
past, and were both anxious for a closer acquaintance.</p>

<p>A fat and full-grown deer was lying dead
upon the stones in a stream-bed. The first guess
was that a tiger, having killed, was about to
eat it, but withdrew for a moment out of sight
<a name="pg_20" id="pg_20" href="#pg_20"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at the sound of the pigeon-shooting. On this
hypothesis we diligently searched in all likely
directions, and made sure there was no tiger near.
Then we gathered round the deer. A faint, faint
smell, perceptible as we closed upon it, showed
that the venison was tending to that disintegration
which awaits all flesh when life departs, and
answered those who were beginning to doubt if
it was dead, because it lay as if it might have
been asleep, and there was no sign to show how
it had died.</p>

<p>“Twelve to twenty-four hours dead, and not
killed by any tiger,” was the first unanimous
conclusion, after minute inspection and confabulation;
and “still fresh enough to be eaten” was the
next decision, all but equally unanimous.</p>

<p>This satisfied most of the men; but Bruce
stood silent, while they knelt round it and began
to ply their knives. I stayed to await developments.
Casting perplexed looks up and down
the stream, Bruce ejaculated, more than once,
“I would give anything to know how that beast
died.” “It’s too soft to roast, but will make
splendid curry,” said the cook, inspecting a joint
cut from the carcass.</p>

<p>When the men had cut off about three times
as much as would suffice to “abate their desire
<a name="pg_21" id="pg_21" href="#pg_21"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>21<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of food,” they began obligingly to discuss what
was puzzling Bruce, and in a short time, so lively
are the Burmese wits, every man seemed to be as
interested as himself in the apparently insoluble
problem. A mystery attracts men, as a light does
the moths; or, as Cicero explains it in his <cite>Offices</cite>
(i.4)—“The peculiarity of man is to seek and follow
after truth. So, as soon as we are relaxed from
our necessary cares and concerns, what we covet
is to see, to hear, and to learn something; and the
knowledge of things obscure or wonderful quickly
appears to us to be indispensable for our comfort
and happiness.”</p>

<p>Wild dogs were as likely as a tiger to have
killed that deer; but equally certain not to leave
the dead uneaten. The wild dogs and the tigers
alike are real professional hunters, who kill in
order to be able to eat and live. They are not
sportsmen, who kill for amusement, that is to say,
for want of occupation. Besides, there were no
marks discoverable of either a tiger or dogs.</p>

<p>The partition of the venison served the purpose
of a post-mortem. When it was seen that the
neck was broken, we looked at the steep ground
on the northern bank and saw how the deer
could have tumbled down; and “killed by a fall”
was the first step to a final verdict.</p>

<p><a name="pg_22" id="pg_22" href="#pg_22"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>But why did it fall? It was useless to suggest,
as one did, “committed suicide in a temporary
state of insanity.” He was gravely assured on
every hand that the deer, however worried, do not
commit suicide.</p>

<p>It would be long to tell the other guesses.
Nobody could find a scratch on the carcass. That
alone disposed of many theories.</p>

<p>Bruce had for some time spoken only in
interjections. His mind was working.
Suddenly he cried, with the abrupt inspiration of
a seer, “I have it! I have it! I see what it was.
This stag and another fought for a hind on
that high bank, and this was the one pushed
over.”</p>

<p>We agreed. Some of us would have agreed to
anything, being tired of the subject. But we really
were convinced; and when Bruce had finished
describing the probable (what a blessed word
probable is, to be sure!—the probable) antlers of the
victor, contrasting them with the poor young brow
of the dead, there were some among us who would
in a little time have been capable of describing in
a witness-box the aforesaid victorious antlers as
things seen and handled. It was a doubter who
said, “If you’re right the tracks of the fighters
must be visible yet. It cannot have been before
<a name="pg_23" id="pg_23" href="#pg_23"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>last night. The ground seems soft up there, and
there has been no rain.”</p>

<p>As soon as the words were spoken, as if by one
consent, the men tore up the steep, Bruce shouting
something that sounded like, “Right you are,
for once!” On hands and knees went some;
and they distributed themselves, to miss nothing,
panting, puffing, all climbing as if a golden fleece
awaited their joint efforts, and earnestly scanning
the ground as they went. They did not compete
though they vied with each other, each helping
his neighbour, in a genial way; and, joyfully
working together, they unconsciously illustrated
the solidarity of humanity in real life.</p>

<p>Soon they were rejoicing and jubilating as
loudly as if a heap of golden fleeces had been
found, for they saw the tracks they went to seek.
The duel of the stags, as it must have happened
in the cool starlight of the preceding night, could
be traced and rehearsed from the hieroglyphics
on the ground by the sharpened wits of the village
specialists, with more confidence than the incidents
of a battle can be deciphered by a historian.
Here it was, in a narrow glade, that they charged
and grappled; there and there they struggled and
pushed to and fro till one went backwards, and
there at last, as you could see, one backed over
<a name="pg_24" id="pg_24" href="#pg_24"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the steep and stumbled suddenly into death, to lie
on the stones below, until we came and, anticipating
other carrion-eaters, cut him up for dinner.</p>

<p>“And now, let’s track the victor!”</p>

<p>Heigh-ho! It was to face a tiger I laid down
my book, and not to follow an amorous deer;
but the tracks led into the stream again. “The
victor went for a drink,” we said to each other,
like children rejoicing to find that they can draw
an inference for themselves, or rather like men
who have learned, as all men do at last, how liable
they are to be mistaken, and are slow to feel sure
of anything till they find that others agree.</p>

<p>Among the stones the tracks were lost. Then
I recalled how Robert the Bruce of Bannockburn
had baffled the bloodhounds following him once,
in his days of difficulty, by walking along a
stream; and I suggested that the deer might in
the same way baffle a modern Bruce. But men
are more knowing than bloodhounds.</p>

<p>“The stag is not a water-buffalo. He’ll quench
his thirst and leave the stream. Won’t he?”</p>

<p>“He must have done so, for he isn’t here.”</p>

<p>“The banks aren’t rocks. We’ll see where he
left as well as where he came, won’t we?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly you shall, if you look long enough.
I’ll stay ten minutes.”</p>

<p><a name="pg_25" id="pg_25" href="#pg_25"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>25<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“I’ll stay till dark.”</p>

<p>It was not needed. The men started to seek
the trail with enthusiasm; and in a few minutes
there was a joyful shout and soon we were following
the vanished stag, as confidently as if he were
bodily in front of us, along one of the deer-paths
that were a feature of these primeval woods. Our
Burmans were admirable. Plain villagers, but
all-round men, observant, they could notice swiftly
and surely the slightest marks on the surface of
the path which were signs of recent tracks. They
had a rare reward. Few modern events have
caused to sated Europeans the sensations they
experienced when, instead of the expected jumble
of many prints, to show where our wanderer
rejoined his fellows, or at least his partner, they came
upon the clean-picked bones and antlers of the
stag at the side of the path, and a few fresh tiger-tracks
that showed how he in turn had <span class="nw">died....</span></p>

<p>“I like this, I like to get to the bottom of things.
I’m glad we came,” cried Bruce. “This is the
kind of thing that makes you realise what life in
the forests truly <span class="nw">is....”</span></p>

<p>“Beasts for beasts,” said his companion, “if one
has to deal with beasts, the four-legged varieties
here are simple and almost harmless compared to
the rascals on two <span class="nw">legs....”</span></p>

<p><a name="pg_26" id="pg_26" href="#pg_26"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Bruce was urgent upon me to write out this
authentic idyll of the woods which he had
elucidated. I had to promise; but I did it vaguely—“when
I have time,” “when I retire,” “when the
spirit moves me”—so that time was not of the
essence of the contract. It never occurred to me
that there was any need to hurry on his account,
for he was the younger man; but now I wish I
had kept my promise sooner. For Bruce is dead.</p>

<h3 title="1. Tigers in the Air">1. TIGERS IN THE AIR</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">In</span> 1895, while doing Forest Settlement work in
the Upper Chindwin district of Upper Burma,
I lived in an atmosphere of tigers. Hardly a day
passed without seeing or hearing some sign of
them. It was a great disappointment, both to my
companion and colleague, Mr Bruce, Deputy
Conservator of Forests, and to myself to finish our
long journeyings without a single encounter. We
spared no pains to compass one; but we were
going fast, with a troop of elephants for baggage,
and were being met at many points by crowds of
men on business; so that it was not a surprise,
although it was a disappointment, to miss seeing
“our friend the enemy” at home. The tiger, as
we were well aware, might say with Tommy
Atkins that he is fighting for meat and not for
glory; and when, in seeking dinner, he caught
sight of an enemy that seemed dangerous, he was
<a name="pg_28" id="pg_28" href="#pg_28"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bound to behave like Brer Rabbit, to lie low and
say nothing. The jungle was continuous, and in
parts so thick that he might at times have been
lying within spitting distance and remained unseen
and unsuspected.</p>

<p>No doubt the tigers saw us many a time, though
we saw none of them. The villagers, in order to
feel safe, went about in twos and threes or in
larger parties, like London policemen in the slums.
Whenever two parties met, they discussed the
latest news of tigers. Among a crowd of items, I
well recollect that both Mr Dickinson, the
Conservator, and Mr Bruce had much to tell me about
the fine performances of C. W. Allan of their
department that year there, and of his experiences
in 1894.</p>

<p>As “half a word fixed, upon or near the spot,
is worth a cart-load of recollection,” according to
authority, I have persuaded Mr Allan, now Deputy
Conservator at Henzada, to let me publish a few
extracts from his <cite>Shikar-Book</cite>, a contemporary
record. It may be as well to mention that,
knowing him well, I believe what he wrote as
firmly as if I had seen it all myself, and that
it tallies completely with what was told me in
1895.</p>

<h3 title="2. Tigers Victorious">2. TIGERS VICTORIOUS
<a name="pg_29" id="pg_29" href="#pg_29"><span class="pagenum"><span

<h5 title="">[<i>Extract from the “Shikar-Book” of C. W. Allan</i>]</h5>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">“During</span><!-- opening quote invisible in original --> the month of March, 1894, I had to
go out into the Kubo Valley, in the Kindat
Forest Division, Upper Chindwin, to do the
demarcation of the Khanpat Reserve. On the 16th
I arrived at the village of Thinzin and halted there
the 17th to collect coolies to do the work, which I
found to be no easy matter. On inquiring the
reason, I was told that there was a man-eater tiger
in that part of the forest, and that it had killed
three men within the last six weeks, and that
people were afraid to go anywhere near the forest.
This was very unpleasant news. However, the
work had to be done and men must be found, so
I ordered the Thugyi (village headman) to hurry
up and get them, and told him that there was
nothing to be afraid of as I had five guns with me
and could look after the men.</p>

<p>“On questioning the Thugyi about the man-eater,
he informed me that the first man killed was
a mahout (elephant driver) employed by the
Bombay Burma Trading Corporation. This man
was carried off in the Pyoungbok stream. He and
another man had gone out to look for their
<a name="pg_30" id="pg_30" href="#pg_30"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>elephant, which had been fettered and turned out
to graze. And it was whilst following up the drag
of the chain that the tiger sprang on to the
mahout who was leading, and was carrying a gun
on his shoulder, and carried him off. The man
who was following the mahout was carrying a dah
(big knife) in his hand, and was just behind the
mahout. He was so taken aback that he could do
nothing to save his companion, so ran away and
informed some other men who were encamped
close by. But they were too frightened to go and
look for the mahout. And it would not have been
much good their going, for by the time they got to
the place the tiger would have finished his meal
and moved off.</p>

<p>“The second man carried off was also a mahout
in the service of the B. B. T. C. He was also
carried off much in the same manner from the
Nansawin stream, and within ten days of the date
the first man was killed. This mahout was out
with a party of some six men hunting for fish in
the stream, when the tiger sprang on to him from
the bank and carried him off before the other men
could do anything. They too did not attempt to
save their comrade, but made tracks out of that
stream as fast as their legs could carry them.</p>

<p>“The third man killed was a Burmese policeman.
<a name="pg_31" id="pg_31" href="#pg_31"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>A party of six constables were out on
patrol, and had camped for the night under a large
teak tree between the Pyoungbok and Nansawin
streams. About four o’clock in the morning one
of the men had got up and lit a fire, and put on a
pot of rice to boil for their breakfast, and had lain
down again beside the other men, intending to
have another forty winks. He had barely laid
himself down when a tiger sneaked up behind the
tree they were sleeping under and seized the end
man by the waist and carried him off. The poor
man shouted for all he was worth, ‘Shoot, shoot,
the tiger is carrying me off.’ This roused the others
and they picked up their guns and tried to shoot,
but the powder or caps being damp, the charges
would not go off. They, however, put on fresh
caps and eventually got the guns to shoot. After
this they fired several shots and shouted, but the
man’s cries had stopped, so they judged that he
must have been killed.</p>

<p>“The constables waited at their camp till
daylight, and then went off to the camp of some
Burmese elephant drivers, which was about three
miles off, and made them collect their elephants,
some seventeen in number, and then returned and
looked for their comrade. They found the remains
within a couple of hundred yards of their night’s
<a name="pg_32" id="pg_32" href="#pg_32"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>camp. The tiger had finished its meal and had
gone off. The Thugyi informed me that although
several shots had been fired in the direction the
tiger had gone it was not frightened, and sat there
and finished its meal.</p>

<p>“Hearing all this, I did not wonder at the men
not wanting to go into the forest. However, the
work had to be done and go I must. Though I
must admit I did not quite appreciate the job.”</p>


<h3 title="3. Working Alongside">3. WORKING ALONGSIDE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">“On</span> the morning of the 18th March some
twenty men turned up, and the Thugyi
informed me that the others would follow. So I
made a move and got as far as the Khanpat
stream, where I halted for a bit and had breakfast
and then moved on again. It was my intention
to make the Pyoungbok camp that day, as I was
told it had a fence round it, made by the patrols
to keep out the tiger. But the coolies would not
move fast enough, so I camped on the Nanpalon
stream.</p>

<p>“After seeing the camp pitched and everything
in place, I told my clerk to make all the men stay
together, and not to let any men go about the
<a name="pg_33" id="pg_33" href="#pg_33"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>forest in ones and twos, for fear of the tiger. I
also told him to have a big fire burning and to
keep a watch of five men at the fire and to relieve
them every two hours, and to call me in case of an
alarm.</p>

<p>“I turned into bed at about nine o’clock, and
had not been in bed ten minutes when the clerk
came and called me, saying the tiger had come. I
jumped out of bed, and taking my rifle ran out.
The men at the fire told me that a pony tied near
them began to get very restless, and kept looking
towards the stream, so they got up and looked,
and saw the tiger not twenty paces off, ready to
rush at them. I asked where it had gone to on
being found out. They replied that it had gone
down into the stream.</p>

<p>“Whilst I was talking to the men, one man, who
was looking in the direction of the stream, said,
‘Look, sir, there it is, going up the bank,’ and sure
enough there it was, about seventy yards off, going
across the bed of the stream. I had a shot and it
sprang up the bank, and just as it was disappearing
I fired a second shot. All the men said I had hit
it, and Maung Kyaw Nya, my forester, was for
going and looking for blood, but I thought this too
dangerous and would not let him go. The next
morning we got up early and went and had a look
<a name="pg_34" id="pg_34" href="#pg_34"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at the place where the tiger had been standing
when I fired at it. I found where both the bullets
had struck the ground. They were both clean misses,
and had struck below the tiger and between its legs.”</p>

<p class="interjection"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>(<i>N.B.</i>—Mr Allan was and is one of the best
hunters in Burma; but, in firing in the dark, one
cannot see one’s sights, and so the best of shots
makes <span class="nw">misses.—D. W.)</span></p>

<p><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>“For the next three days nothing happened and
the coolies seemed to have got over their fright
and were working well.</p>

<p>“On the 23rd I moved camp to a place on the
Nansawin stream. The forest there was very
dense and I did not at all like the idea of camping
there, but as that was the only place where there
was water, I had a place cleared and pitched my
tent, and then went out to inspect the work. I
gave orders to Maung Kyaw Nya to go ahead and
pick out the way the line of demarcation should
go in, and also to see how far the Thonhmwason”
(that is, Three-Waters-Meeting, a camping-place
where three streams met) “was from my camp of
that day.</p>

<p>“At 3 p.m. a man came to me from the camp
and said that Mg. Kyaw Nya had returned, as
he had been chased by a tiger. On my return to
<a name="pg_35" id="pg_35" href="#pg_35"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>camp in the evening I sent for Kyaw Nya and
questioned him as to why he had not carried out
my order. He replied that he and two other men
were going along the foot of the hill following the
boundary, when they came on to a half-eaten
sambur (big deer). They were going to take the
flesh and bring it to camp for their dinner, when
they heard a rustling in the leaves, and on looking
round saw a tiger coming to see what they wanted
with its dinner. The men, seeing the tiger coming,
dropped the sambur and went for all they were
worth, till they got out into the bed of the stream,
and then came down it to my camp.</p>

<p>“I thought the men were afraid to go out by
themselves to locate the boundary, and had
invented the yarn about the tiger. Mg. Kyaw Nya
said, ‘If you do not believe me, sir, I will show
you the place.’</p>

<p>“On the morning of the 25th I went out with
Mg. Kyaw Nya and three or four men, and they
took me to the place where the tiger’s kill had
been, and sure enough there had been a kill there,
but it had been finished off during the night and
there was nothing but the skull and feet left. On
my return to camp I had tea, and was thinking of
tying out a goat and sitting up for the tiger, but I
did not like the idea of having to get off the
<a name="pg_36" id="pg_36" href="#pg_36"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>machan (platform made in a tree) and come back
to the tent in the dark, so I gave it up.”</p>

<p class="interjection"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>(Another objection, fatal to this plan, was that
the men would have been afraid to stay in the
camp at night by <span class="nw">themselves.—D. W.)</span></p>

<p><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>“About 4 p.m. the men were returning from work,
when I heard a great shouting not far from camp,
so went out in the direction and met them returning.
The forester in charge informed me that a
tiger had charged out at the line of men and had
tried to take one from the centre, and that the
man had thrown his dah (big knife) at the beast,
on which it bolted back into the grass.”</p>


<h3 title="4. At very Close Quarters">4. AT VERY CLOSE QUARTERS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">“On</span> seeing that the tiger was round our camp
I took extra precautions and made all
the men stop in one place just behind my tent;
and gave orders to my Indian servants to have
their dinner early, and to sleep with the Burmese
coolies. My cook, an Indian, would not stop near
the Burmans, though told to do so several times.
He had his kitchen fire just in front of my tent.
However, I told him he must sleep with the other
men. The other Indians also told him not to be
<a name="pg_37" id="pg_37" href="#pg_37"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a fool and stay away by himself. To them he
replied that he was not afraid, and that if it was
his fate the tiger would have him. He said, ‘If it
takes me, it will be a case of one crunch and all
will be over,’ and this is just what happened.</p>

<p>“I was having dinner early, before it got quite
dark, so as to get the men together. The cook
had given me my soup and had cleared the plate
and put a roast fowl before me, and had gone back
to the fire and was standing with a knife in his
hand watching the pudding on the fire.</p>

<p>“I was just carving the chicken, when I heard
the cook give a frightened cry, and on looking up
I saw the tiger spring on to the cook. In jumping
up I upset the table and the lamp on it, also a glass
of beer that had just been poured out for me, and
ran out shouting at the tiger, and threw my table
knife at it. My dogs, two terriers and a spaniel, were
sitting by my table, and jumped up and ran after
the tiger with me and attacked it. One terrier and
the spaniel were killed on the spot, and the other
dog got away. In spite of this the tiger went off
with the cook. I thought the tiger had got the cook
by the back, but the sweeper who was standing
close by with my goats” (that is to say, had been
there when the tiger came), “said it had got him
by the head, and so it turned out to be the case.</p>

<p><a name="pg_38" id="pg_38" href="#pg_38"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“On hearing me shout, the sweeper ran into the
tent and got my rifle and cartridges and handed
them to me. I put in a cartridge and fired in the
direction the tiger had gone, and this had the effect
of making him drop the cook, but we did not know
it at the time as no one would venture into the
forest to look for him. This of course upset everyone
in camp, and all huddled round my tent as
close as they could and shouted and beat tins all
night. No one would even go to replenish the fire
unless I went with them, though it was not three
yards from my tent. All that night the tiger kept
moving round the tent and I kept it off by firing
shots whenever we heard it walking in the leaves
and saw its eyes shining like live coals in the dark.”</p>


<p class="tb"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>Here it may be noted that the eyes of a tiger,
shining through the blackness of the utter dark,
are a phenomenon hard to forget, if once you see
them. In this instance, whatever strange light
shone in them may have been intensified by the
glare of the camp-fire reflected in those glistening
optics. But no such addition was possible in
another case credibly reported to me and of more
recent date in the extreme north of Burma. A
tiger ventured into the sepoy lines one night, and
entering the open door of a hut, it killed and
<a name="pg_39" id="pg_39" href="#pg_39"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>carried away a man asleep in bed. His comrades
chased and mobbed the beast, which dropped the
corpse and escaped. The sepoys, taking counsel
together, put out the lights and hushed all noises,
as if everyone was asleep; and in fact they were
back in their huts, and the door of the dead man’s
dwelling stood open as before. Only, in ambush,
below or beside the bed, in a dark corner, a brave
man was waiting, rifle ready; and the tiger did
come back to that identical door that night, and
was shot, exactly as the sepoys had hoped. What
lingers in the memory best, of all the details of
that adventure, is that the man who lay in wait
told a magistrate, who told me, that when the
tiger came, all he saw was “the eyes in the doorway,
shining into the room like two coloured
lamps, filling the room with tinted light.” So he felt
that hiding was impossible and “banged away.”</p>

<p>One other remark may be intercalated, to let
readers realise what is what. Even to men of
experience in tiger attacks, the swift suddenness
of events is a continual surprise. The tiger
practises “surprise tactics,” and his attack often
is, and always is when he can manage it, like a
railway collision—it takes long to tell, but only
a few seconds to happen.</p>

<p>Let us now return to Mr Allan’s journal.</p>


<p class="tb"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span><a name="pg_40" id="pg_40" href="#pg_40"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“Early next morning, as soon as it was light
enough to see, I started to look for the body of
the cook, and found it not ten paces from where
he had been cooking. The jungle, as I said before,
was very thick, so we could not see it at night.”</p>

<p class="interjection"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>(The tiger must have dropped the corpse when
Mr Allan fired. He had therefore lost his supper.
Probably enough that was why he continued
prowling <span class="nw">round.—D. W.)</span></p>

<p><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>“The tiger had caught the cook by the head as
the sweeper had said, for one fang had gone into
his right eye and had knocked it out, another had
gone into his throat just below the chin, and two
had gone into the skull and neck at the back. So
it must have taken the whole head into its mouth,
for it was a pulp with the brains coming out.</p>

<p>“We dug a shallow grave for the poor old cook
and buried him, and then left that forest as fast as
the men could lay legs to the ground, for nothing
would induce them to stop another hour....
They yelled and shouted till they got right clear
of the forest.</p>

<p>“In leaving the forest no one wanted to be the
last in the line for fear of being taken from the
back, so I brought up the rear.”</p>


<p class="tb"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>It only remains to be added that in 1895, though
<a name="pg_41" id="pg_41" href="#pg_41"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the tigers “remained as usual,” Mr Allan finished
the demarcation work so tragically interrupted,
and even took his wife to see the grave of the
cook.</p>


<h3 title="5. The Charge of the Tigress">5. THE CHARGE OF THE TIGRESS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Coming</span> to 1909, there is an episode in his
<cite>Shikar-Book</cite> about a tigress, which for
various reasons may be <span class="nw">transcribed:—</span></p>


<p class="tb"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>“... 14th April.—I started up to inspect the
Banbwebin fire line ... accompanied by my
wife ... an Indian and two Burmans....
After we had gone about five miles up the ...
path, ... we heard bamboos being broken. The
Burmans said there must be a herd of wild
elephants feeding on the flowered bamboos. I
thought they might possibly be bison or a
rhinoceros, so walked on to see what they really were.
The Indian was walking ahead of me, and I was
following, looking down the side of the hill from
which the sound of the bamboos being broken
came, when Barhan, the Indian peon, stopped and
said ‘Bag’ (tiger). I looked up and saw the tiger
crossing the path about sixty paces ahead of me,
so ... had a quick shot at it. On which it turned
round and came down the hill straight at me....
<a name="pg_42" id="pg_42" href="#pg_42"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>42<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>My wife, who was just behind me, on seeing it
come down the hill, called out, ‘It is coming.’ ...
It came on, and when less than thirty paces from
me I fired the second barrel and knocked it over.
After receiving the shot it fell and lay on the
ground, trying to drag itself towards us.... It
put its head up and snarled and showed its
teeth.... The Burmans, who were very excited,
kept on saying, ‘Give it another shot quick, or it
will get up and do for us.’ So after a bit I put in
another cartridge and walked up a few paces and
gave it a bullet in the chest and finished it off.</p>

<p>“After giving it a shot in the chest I walked
round and got above it, and then approached
cautiously with my gun at the ready to give it
another shot if necessary; but after throwing a
clod or two of earth at it, and finding that it did
not move, I walked up and pulled its tail, and
when I found that it was dead I called out to my
wife, who was close by all the time, and she
came up.</p>

<p>“We found it to be a tigress ... measuring
eight feet and five inches as she lay.... The
first shot had missed and the second ... caught
her at the point of the shoulder. On looking at
my gun, I found that the 200 yards leaf sight had
got pushed up, and that made me shoot high. I
<a name="pg_43" id="pg_43" href="#pg_43"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>43<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was carrying the gun in my right hand, but
holding it across my back, and in pulling it
forward in a hurry, the leaf sight had got pushed
up, and I did not notice it in the excitement of
the <span class="nw">moment....</span></p>

<p>“Maung Nita, one of the Burmans who was
with me, said, ‘Sir, if you had not finished her
with the second shot we would all have been lying
kicking on the ground.’</p>

<p>“As three men were not able to lift her, my
wife rode back to our camp and called other eight
men, and they slung her on poles and carried her
into camp.</p>

<p>“On dissecting the tigress, I found that she had
nothing in her stomach and appeared to have had
no food for some time. She was evidently out
shikaring (hunting), and was after the animals that
I heard breaking <span class="nw">bamboos.” ...</span></p>


<p class="tb"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>In a private letter to me at the time, Mr Allan
<span class="nw">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“... Had I missed the second shot she would
have had us.... She was very angry. She was
hungry and meant business. On opening her we
found that she ... had evidently not had a meal
for some days.” ... This illustrates a truth which
is often forgotten by us. The big beasts live from
<a name="pg_44" id="pg_44" href="#pg_44"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>44<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hand to mouth, like improvident working men. A
dog may bury a bone, a tiger return to a kill, and
a leopard has been known to put half a corpse or
an unfinished bit of venison up a tree for security.
But beyond the next meal they never look. It is
only the insects of the universe, like ants and bees,
or such animals as squirrels, that practise thrift.
Hence arose the Jewish proverb about considering
the ways of the ant in order to be wise. There is
no such lesson to be learned from the cat.</p>

<p>One can be sorry for the tigress all the same.
Think of her empty stomach, and perhaps hungry
cubs in her lair; and then this big, strong Englishman,
with his diabolical machinery in his hand,
molesting her as she was stalking the wild cattle.
“She meant business,” said he. Of course she did.
Did anyone think she was hunting for amusement?</p>

<p>No matter now! Her body lies inert enough, a
subject for their inquisitive knives to her
indifferent.</p>

<p>Put yourself in the skin of that tigress, if you
can. Think what a gunshot means to a wild beast,
and consider how, when fired at, she “faced the
music” in the real sense of that phrase, and went
“straight at the guns,” as gallantly as the Light
Brigade at Balaklava. As even the enemy notes—“After
<a name="pg_45" id="pg_45" href="#pg_45"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>45<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>receiving the shot, _it fell and lay on the
ground, trying to drag itself towards us.... It
put its head up and snarled and showed its teeth._”
... Was she not like the glorious Englishman,
who, when his legs were cut away, still fought
upon his stumps? Did any hero of Homer’s ever
surpass that sorely-stricken tigress? Could any
living creature have done more? And yet there
are men to be found who call the big cats cowards!
I never heard Mr Allan do that, nor any other man
of sense who knew them well at first hand.</p>

<p>No wonder tigers flourished in the days of old.
It is the invention of gunpowder, and then of
breechloaders, that has handicapped them
hopelessly. The long guerilla war between them and
us has lasted for scores of millenniums; but the end
is now in sight. Let us not libel the brave that
are doomed to disappear. Let us not rail at the
conquered. If they were fierce and strong, they
were not cruel. As Nature made them, so they
filled their function. They came, and chased, and
conquered, impelled by hunger: and now that
their hour has come they are going away. The
day is at hand when the big wild cats shall all be
as completely extinct as the vanished giants that
wallowed in the primeval slime.</p>

 />THE GIRL AND THE TIGRESS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">This</span> is a story that has been often told; and
I confess I did not believe it when I heard it
in 1895, in the district where it happened. Long
afterwards, in 1908, Mr G. Tilly, who had been the
District Superintendent of Police on the spot at
the time, told me he held a local inquiry, and was
so completely satisfied of the truth of it that he
recommended the payment of a reward of R100
to the girl, and the Deputy Commissioner
and the Commissioner agreed with him, and
the Chief Commissioner of Burma sanctioned the
reward, which was paid. In the absence of any
motive for rash credulity on the part of these
officers, this might seem enough; but I happened
to be acquainted with Mr Grant Brown, who is
now the Deputy Commissioner of that district,
called the Upper Chindwin, and wrote to him
about it. He replied on 21/2/09: “... I
remembered the incident quite well as told in the
<cite>Rangoon Gazette</cite>, and should have included it in
<a name="pg_47" id="pg_47" href="#pg_47"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>my article on Burmese women if I had been able
to remember more of the details; but I had no
idea that it took place in this district. Curiously
enough, the very first person I asked was the
headman of the village where the thing happened.
He could give me no details beyond those you
mention.... The heroine is dead, and as I
thought I was sure to find an account of what
happened in the record-room I did not make
further inquiries. A search has been made, however,
without <span class="nw">result....”</span></p>

<p>The “article” mentioned is Mr Grant Brown’s
article in <cite>The Women of all Nations</cite>, by Messrs
Joyce &amp; Thomas, published by the Messrs Cassell
lately.</p>

<p>Failing to find the record of the original inquiry
held by Mr Tilly, which had perished, as a thing
no longer needed, in a periodical destruction of
papers, Mr Grant Brown had a new inquiry held,
and the vernacular record of it is now before me.
I sent a set of interrogatories, which have been
answered by Ma Shway U, an eye-witness, and the
head man of the village and another man, who
were soon on the scene, measured the tigress and
did everything else that needed to be done. None
of these persons has any motive for misstatement,
and the chance of mistake is infinitesimal. That
<a name="pg_48" id="pg_48" href="#pg_48"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>time has not altered their stories I can myself
testify, for what they say tallies with what I was
told in 1895.</p>

<p>Readers can now see how my doubts have been
removed, and must be impatient to know what it
was that I was so slow to believe. As Mr Tilly
tells me the newspapers merely gave more or less
abbreviated versions of his report, I have not
referred to them.</p>

<p>The scene was Seiktha village on the Chindwin,
an Upper Burman tributary of the Irrawaddy, in
one of the districts that form the southern fringe
of the mountains between Burma and Assam.
One day in 1894 three nut-brown girls set out
from Seiktha to cut firewood in the forest, making
for a likely place they knew, a little south-east of
their village. They carried one or two heavy
knives or choppers, like butchers’ cleavers, such as
are common in Burman houses.</p>

<p>Now if there had only been a man with them, or
even a big boy, he would certainly there and then,
in going and coming, have walked in front, bearing
a spear or dah, a big curved knife like a sword.
What makes it needful to mention a thing so obvious
to us who have lived there is that Englishwomen
sometimes resent, as degrading to their sex, the
Oriental custom that makes the man stalk in front;
<a name="pg_49" id="pg_49" href="#pg_49"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>whereas a little reflection would show them, when
familiar with plain facts of this kind, that there are
reasons for it honourable to human nature. It is
not as a master that a man, who is a man, precedes
a woman, or goes into war, or business, or politics;
but as a pioneer, protector, provider, and in short
head servant. The old maid, at whom Dean
Ramsay made us laugh, because she “thought a
man was perfect salvation,” was moved by a wise
inherited instinct, far different from what simple
sophisticated persons have hitherto supposed.</p>

<p>On this occasion there was no man at all, and
in the absence of any natural protector it was “go
as you please.” A tigress in the bush saw her
chance. The lightest-limbed and lightest-laden of
the trio was a little girl, Mintha by name, who ran
on in front. The tigress seized her and carried
her away.</p>

<p>There is a lot, at times, in etymology. An
Englishman who knows Burmese would tell you
that <i xml:lang="mya" lang="mya">Mintha</i> means prince, or son of an official
(min); but, as written in Burmese, without a long
accent on the <em>tha</em>, and pronounced like an ordinary
English word with the stress in front, the name
Mintha has another modest meaning which you
may discover from a dictionary, but can only with
difficulty persuade a Burman to tell you. It means
<a name="pg_50" id="pg_50" href="#pg_50"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><i>Better-than-an-Official</i>, a name curiously recalling
the kind of names that were common in England
in the great days of Cromwell.</p>

<p>“We know what judges can be made to do,”
said Selden, grimly.</p>

<p>“We know what officials are,” the Burmans have
been saying for centuries; and they class them
with thieves and plagues, perhaps with more
emphasis to-day than ever before. So Mintha is
an unpretentious name, and so common that the
little girl who bore it had probably never thought
of the meaning of it, and would certainly have
referred you to her mother if you had asked her
about it.</p>

<p>She was perhaps eleven years old, but small for
that age, this brown little maiden whom they called
“Better-than-an-Official,” and swift and silent like
a dream the tigress stepped out and picked her
up and carried her away between its teeth, as a
cat does a little mouse.</p>

<p>Her older sister, Ngway Bwin, which means
Silver-blossom, a girl on the verge of womanhood,
about fourteen years old, was next behind her, and
beheld her taken. She quickly turned to the third
girl, Shway U or Grain-of-Gold, who happened at
that moment to have a chopper in her hand; and,
snatching the chopper, little Silver-blossom ran at
<a name="pg_51" id="pg_51" href="#pg_51"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the very top of her speed after the tigress. She
overtook it, and lifting the big knife high above
her head with both hands, she brought it down
heavily on the animal’s head. It dropped little
Mintha, “Better-than-an-Official,” and stood as if
it were stunned. It was easy to see the need of
keeping it stunned. Silver-blossom knew that
that was her only chance. So hammer, hammer,
hammer, cut succeeding cut, the little Burmese
maiden killed the tigress.</p>

<p>Grain-of-Gold was the only other person near.
She always said, and says still (1909), that she did
nothing but look on. The village headman
reported, and still reports, that the animal, which
was shown to everybody in 1894, was a full-grown
tigress in the prime of life, measuring “8 cubits and
2 meiks.” A cubit, in rough village measures, is
still the original cubit, from the elbow to the
farthest finger-tip, and a “meik” is the width of a
clenched fist with the thumb standing out. So 8 cubits
and 2 meiks can hardly be less than 11 or
12 feet; but the villagers measure along the
curved outline of the body, so we may conclude
the straight measurement was 8 or 9 feet.</p>

<p>The soft brown skin of Better-than-an-Official
had been broken and she was a little hurt on the
back of the neck and on one arm; but these injuries
<a name="pg_52" id="pg_52" href="#pg_52"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>52<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>were so slight that it is likely the tigress meant to
give its cubs the pleasure of playing with her,
instead of which Better-than-an-Official, saved by her
sister and quickly cured of her scratches, is now
reported to be living at Kule village, Mingin
township. The sister, Silver-blossom herself, was quite
unhurt. She became, deservedly, the pride of the
countryside, but “died of a decline” ten years
afterwards.</p>

<p>If her adventure appeared in a romance one
would smile at the absurdity of the author who
expected to be believed for a moment. Yet, after
carefully questioning everybody concerned, Mr Tilly,
who is a man of sense, believed it at the
time and has never doubted it; and Mr Grant
Brown, after a new local inquiry, believes it; and
so do I. Let readers please themselves.</p>

<p>It may assist them to a right conclusion to
remind them that Michelet has shown that Joan
of Arc seems stranger to us than she really was
because we are ignorant of history. Her performance
was glorious for herself and France, one of
the most glorious episodes in the history of the
world; but all the same it was only the superlative
of many similar doings of brave French women.
Precisely in the same way it has to be remembered
that, like hens emboldened to fly in the faces of
<a name="pg_53" id="pg_53" href="#pg_53"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dogs or boys in defence of chicks, many girls in
charge of brothers or sisters have been known to
surpass belief in their feats of devotion. So Silver-blossom
was not odd in the sense of being peculiar.
She was like other brave girls, only more so.</p>

<p>At the same time it would be wrong to
minimise what she did. It is the exact truth to
say she expanded the range of human possibilities.
Think of a Burmese child doing that!</p>

<p>Let them who know no better “explain” the
miracle. The man who ceases to wonder at it
does not understand it. I frankly admire the girl,
and have no “explanation,” unless it be one to
quote the <span class="nw">hymn—</span></p>

 />THE OLD MEN AND THE TIGER</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">This</span> was told me in 1908 by Mr Thomson,
who as District Magistrate had held an
inquest at the time upon the tragedy; and his
recollections have been verified and supplemented
by Mr Webb, the present District Magistrate.
The depositions have, in ordinary course, been
destroyed; but the details that are still recoverable
seem to be sufficient.</p>

<p>The time was 1900, and the scene was Zwettaw
village, Thongwa township, not far from Rangoon.
The old headman, U Myat Thin, described in
confidential official registers which he never saw as
“an easy-going old Talaing“ or native of Lower
Burma, was sauntering outside the village about
midday, watching his grandchildren, who were
playing near him. Suddenly a tiger appeared and
seized and carried away his grand-daughter. That
kind of thing is done with the speed of thought;
and Hercules himself, in the old man’s place, could
not have prevented the tiger getting the child.
<a name="pg_55" id="pg_55" href="#pg_55"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>55<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Probably Hercules himself, if unarmed, would have
done no more than the old man did, namely, run
into the village and shout for help.</p>

<p>But who was to help? Every man and woman
fit for work was away in the fields. Only the old
people and children were in the village. He took
a spear from his house, and three other old men
like himself did likewise. The four of them
followed the tiger at once, and tracked and ran
with such goodwill that they overtook him, though
they were too late to save the child.</p>

<p>One of the finest traits of character which I have
noticed in Burmese villagers is their readiness to
fight to recover from a wild beast the body of any
person it has killed. Let a European try to take a
bone from a bulldog and he may be able to guess,
faintly and distantly, at what these four old men
were undertaking when they closed with a famishing
tiger, to fight him for his freshly-killed food.
They had no firearms, no missiles of any kind, not
even bows and arrows. They had nothing to rely
on but each other, as, with one spirit, they attacked
him, thrusting at his vitals with their spears. The
fight was too unequal. He killed one of them,
and with a stroke of his paw he broke the shoulder
of the grandfather, and so escaped away.</p>

<p>The news was sent to the men in the fields, and as
<a name="pg_56" id="pg_56" href="#pg_56"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>soon as possible a new party took up the trail, including
policemen with guns. They had not far to go.
In the next field they found the tiger—dead. He
had been gored to death by a herd of buffaloes
that had been peacefully grazing there when he
came among them. If he had not been wounded
they would probably not have attacked him, or
he would not have lingered long enough to give
them a chance. So the old men had not fought
in vain.</p>

<p>A herdsman of experience has said to me:
“If the tiger was bleeding, the sight of his blood
would make the buffaloes charge him.” That
coincides with a red rag irritating a bull in
England; but another herdsman said it was the
smell, and several thought the wound made no
difference. “A buffalo will not stand to be eaten
by a tiger, but at sight of one stampedes, either at
him or away from him.” Very likely, indeed.</p>

<p>“I think the grandfather recovered,” continued
Mr Thomson. “I know I recommended a good
reward and that it was paid.” It appears from the
official registers that he was quite well before the
end of the year. On 12th December 1900 the
Assistant Commissioner felt bound to note, as a
matter of business: “The daily pilgrimage to the
local Kyaung (a Buddhist monastery) is the end
<a name="pg_57" id="pg_57" href="#pg_57"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>57<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of his existence now, I think.” Why not? In the
heroic days of Greece a time of prayer was deemed
the fittest ending to a well-spent life.</p>

<p>It was not till 29th June 1908 that the registers
tell of him what has some day to be told of us
all—“Deceased. For successor <span class="nw">see ...”</span></p>

<p>So far as can be discovered, the brave old man
paid no heed whatever to the rewards, or to what
was thought about him. It was right to honour
such gallantry in every possible way; but the deed
was one no money could have purchased, and the
story is one I like to tell whenever I hear anybody
who knows no better talking of the “cowardice
of the Burmans.”</p>

 />RECOVERING THE CORPSE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> present Deputy Commissioner of Pyapon
district, Burma (Major Nethersole, 1909), is
my authority for this incident, which is selected as
the most remarkable of several of its kind. He
investigated it on the spot, and told me of it at
the time. He himself gave as many days as he
could spare to hunting the tiger concerned, which
killed eight men in Pyapon district before it met
its fate.</p>

<p>One of them was old Po An, the headman of
Eyya village. “Eyya” or “Irra” is the first part
of the name of our local Mississippi, the Irrawaddy,
and the village is, in fact, at the mouth of
the great water-way so called, though it is only
one of many water-ways through which the mighty
river mingles with the sea. In other words, the
village is on the coast, and about the middle of
the delta, between Rangoon and Bassein.</p>

<p>In the last week of 1908 Po An and his son,
and a friend of his own age (about sixty), left
<a name="pg_59" id="pg_59" href="#pg_59"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>home together to get bamboos. They went in a
little boat, landed where they intended, entered
the muddy woods and cut what they wanted,
and started to carry the bamboos to their
boat.</p>

<p>They had heard that there was a man-killing
tiger “somewhere thereabouts,” but the Burman
with a knife in his hand is not easily frightened in
the forest. They made the mistake, which is the
besetting sin of brave men and used to be called
English, of despising the enemy, and did not even
keep close together. In returning bamboo-laden,
Po An lagged behind “about forty yards,” but
nobody thought anything of that. His son and
companion heard a noise in the jungle too, but
did not think of it till a minute or two later, when
they ceased to hear the sound of Po An behind,
and shouted, “Are you all right?” Receiving no
reply they looked round. Not seeing him they
laid down their burdens and retraced their steps,
but had not far to go. In a glade through which
they had come they saw the prostrate figure
of Po An and the tiger standing over him.</p>

<p>They were only two men, and one of them was
old, and they had no weapons but the big knives
they had been using. But instantly they flourished
their knives and moved forward, shouting
<a name="pg_60" id="pg_60" href="#pg_60"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and yelling as if they were the advance guard of
an army of men.</p>

<p>The tiger, a big animal in the prime of life,
looked up at them in deliberate surprise, and
visibly hesitated. Then, as they approached, he
moved aside, slowly and reluctantly, into cover,
as if to watch what was going to happen and
consider what to do.</p>

<p>The two men ran forward, snatched up the
corpse and started for the boat, looking round
continually, brandishing their knives and shouting,
and seeing, or thinking they saw, those
great eyes glaring at them through the bushes.
They said they even heard the tiger following.
Perhaps they did. Time after time they thought
it was about to spring upon them, and faced
towards the sound, real or imaginary, with knives
uplifted and loud shouts of defiance. They
reached the boat and got on board, but did not take
time to loose the rope. They cut it and pushed off.</p>

<p>Next morning the elder of the two took Major
Nethersole and another officer to the place, and
there they saw the severed rope and the tracks of
the tiger patrolling on the muddy banks. The
tides had been such that the tracks must have
been made after the men departed, and left no
room for doubt that the tiger had come after them
<a name="pg_61" id="pg_61" href="#pg_61"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to the water’s edge, and there lingered long, going
up and down as if in a cage, and looking across
the waters on which the men had disappeared.</p>

<p>It was several days before the son of Po An and
his old friend discovered, as their excitement
abated, how badly their nerves had been shaken.
Their sleep began to be broken by hideous
dreams.</p>

<p>That was more than three months ago. The
tiger is dead now (April 1909). His skull and
hide can be seen at Pyapon. But still, I believe,
though now at greater and greater intervals,
sometimes the one and sometimes the other of the
two brave men is wakened by the nightmare of
those awful eyes, and shrieks and shrieks to his
neighbours to come and stay beside him.</p>

 />THE INSPECTOR’S ESCAPE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">It</span> was about February 1891, and on the
left or eastern bank of the Sittang River
in Toungoo district, Lower Burma, that an
inspector of police was riding northwards along
a cart-road, through the woods, as the daylight
was quitting the sky, and “suddenly,” to use
his own words, “I seemed, at one and the same
instant, to get a terrific blow in the small of
the back, and to feel the pony under me springing
upwards, as if it were jumping to the sky.”
He completed his description by gestures.</p>

<p>A listener suggested, “As if it were suddenly
galloping up a wall?”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said he. “The next I felt was
that I seemed to fall back upon something soft,
and that’s all I know. The next I saw was
the people bending over me, and I could hear
one say to another, ‘He’s not dead yet,’ and
others said, ‘He’s dead,’ but none of them
touched me, and I tried to speak, but could
<a name="pg_63" id="pg_63" href="#pg_63"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>63<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>not. Then after a long time somebody saw
I was breathing, and somebody put something
under my head, and ... I am not hurt,
so far as I am aware,” concluded the inspector,
“but feel stunned and queer, and horribly
helpless.”</p>

<p>The villagers said, “We saw the pony come
galloping with an empty saddle along the road
which goes through the village, and in the
middle of the village it stopped short and made
a noise. It was quivering. Its hind-quarters
were bleeding from great tiger’s claw-marks as
you see them yet.”</p>

<p>The poor beast was still sore from the
scratches a month afterwards. Whether it ever
recovered I never heard.</p>

<p>With a celerity and courage characteristic of
the unspoiled Burman, every man in the village
soon had a da (big knife) or home-made spear
in his hand, and many had torches or lamps as
well. But while they thus prepared for action
promptly, it has to be noted that there was a
certain hesitation about starting. Some objected.
Why? The pony had been recognised as the
inspector’s. He was rather popular than otherwise,
but he was a policeman. No Burman
could say with truth that he thought it right
<a name="pg_64" id="pg_64" href="#pg_64"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>64<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to save the life of a policeman. Even the older
men, who were addicted to religion, could only
say, “He’s a man, after all.” Equally with the
rest they believed that any policeman in the
pay of the English is irretrievably doomed to
hell, and has deserved to be. But, what made the
pious elders on this occasion more readily silent
than they might otherwise have been, there
were several who delivered themselves of sentiments
that might be translated by a verse of
an old English <span class="nw">ballad:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="hang">“Saddled and bridled</div>
<div class="i1"><span class="ns">  </span>And booted rade he;</div>
<div>Toom hame (empty home) cam’ the saddle,</div>
<div class="i1"><span class="ns">  </span>But never cam’ he!”</div>
</div><!-- stanza -->
</div><!-- poetry -->
</div><!-- poetry-container -->

<p>“It’s not a man that you’re going to save.
You’re likely to be late for that! It’s a corpse
you’re going to take from a tiger.”</p>

<p>This was conclusive. The most scrupulous
Burman can risk his life with a clear conscience
in fighting a tiger to recover a corpse. So the
crowd set out.</p>

<p>Great was their wonder to find the inspector
prostrate upon the road, unconscious, but
unscratched. When they had heard his story
they said to <span class="nw">me,—</span></p>

<p>“The tiger cannot have seen him at all.
<a name="pg_65" id="pg_65" href="#pg_65"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Lying in wait here, it must have seen only his
piebald pony, and, leaping so as to land on its
shoulders, it must have knocked its nose severely
against the man’s back and slipped down. Then
he fell upon it, and so perplexed it more than
ever, and it would step aside into cover to consider
awhile.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the shrewdest remark made on the
incident was this: “When struck on the back,
the man must have let out a howl. That would
frighten the tiger!” The inspector did not
remember that, but could not be expected to
remember it. He would do it without thinking.</p>

<p>It was his own and the general opinion that
if help had not come, as it did, the tiger would
have come back; and, humanity mastering
prejudice, the people said, “We are glad we came.”</p>

<p>The fright made him talk of leaving the
police and leading a new life. But his salary
was good. He was like the rich man in Scripture,
who had great possessions. The villagers did
not blame him for changing his mind and not
resigning. It was as much in earnest as in jest
that they said, “He may become religious, when
he takes his pension.”</p>

<p>About the same time as this wonderful escape,
a lonely leper who lived in a hut, like a hermit, on
<a name="pg_66" id="pg_66" href="#pg_66"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the opposite side of the river, disappeared for
ever, and the few bloody rags that were left and
the tell-tale footprints showed that the tiger had
come upon him, like a thief in the night, and
carried him bodily away.</p>

<p>“We are very sorry for the leper,” said the
villagers to the inspector, when he next rode by,
and the fate of the leper was discussed. “We
are very sorry for the leper, and for the tiger too.
Either your pony or yourself would have been
more wholesome eating.”</p>

<h2 title="IX. The Sound of Humanity"><span class="chapnumber">IX

 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]</span></span></a></span><br
 />THE SOUND OF HUMANITY</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> leopard, if not the boldest of all the feline
tribes, is at least the best acquainted with
mankind. His partiality for dogs makes him
familiar with men’s villages. More than any
other beast, perhaps, he is prompt to turn at
bay when wounded and “charge home.” Many
a man has lost his life to a wounded leopard.
Yet even a leopard is daunted by the sound of
humanity.</p>

<p>In 1888 a big one was seen in a large village,
not far from Maulmain, one morning. The
scattered wooden houses and plentiful shrubs afforded
cover. He was merely looking for a dog, and the
people said he had repeatedly taken one unnoticed.
But this morning a woman saw him and shrieked.
The other women shrieked responsive, the children
screamed, the dogs barked, and, amid the deafening
uproar, the men of the village, and some
chance visitors who happened to have guns,
concerted measures, partly by dumb show, being
<a name="pg_68" id="pg_68" href="#pg_68"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>scarcely able to make themselves audible to each
other.</p>

<p>As soon as the men had obtained silence on one
side of the clump of brushwood, wherein Mr Spots
was waiting for the clamour to subside, and the
men began yelling on the other sides of it, the
leopard stepped cautiously into the open on the
silent quarter, looking like a detected thief,
preparing to run, with his tail between his legs, like a
dog that feels he is about to be kicked and
deserves it. On seeing an unexpected man in
front of him, the leopard shrank aside, apologetically,
as if abashed. The man killed it. A sense
of what he owed to the other men prevented him
allowing it to escape; and so he fired. But it was
“against the grain.” He felt like slaying a man
who had asked for quarter; but, after all, no
quarter is ever expected or given on either side
in humanity’s protracted war with dangerous
cats.</p>

<p>In this case the leopard heard no shot until the
shot was fired that killed it. It was cowed by the
cries. So we need not wonder that the tiger,
which is more sylvan in habit and less used to
human noises, can be “beaten” out of shelter by
the shouting of men and boys. When the tiger
breaks out and kills a beater it is not because it
<a name="pg_69" id="pg_69" href="#pg_69"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>has found the heart to face the yelling crowd, but
because it is desperate.</p>

<p>We should remember that leopards and tigers
love peace as much as do the Quakers. There
is no jingo nonsense about them. They never
want to fight, and absolutely will not fight unless
they have to. Their single aim is to get their
dinners, which, as Bismarck reminded a deputation,
is the first business of every living being. “Good”
or “bad” depends on the way of doing it, he
might have added. The war between cats and
us is not due to their malignant hostility, but to
their physiological necessities. If we were content
to let them prey upon us there would be peace.
On other terms there can be none. A compromise
is impossible. What had to be settled, when the
first Hercules took up his club, was whether the
world was to be filled by men or cats. It is now
some millenniums since the ultimate issue became
obvious; but the end is not reached yet.</p>

<p>Of course it is not altogether an aversion to
fighting that makes the tiger seek for peace at any
price when men surround him. Try for a moment
to think in the skin of a tiger. The little jungle
dogs are formidable to him, as he is an individualist,
and they run in packs. They kill the big
deer before his nose, including some he has to
<a name="pg_70" id="pg_70" href="#pg_70"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>leave alone. But what is the union of the dogs
compared to the solidarity of men, who “have pity
upon one another,” as Mahomed noticed? And
think again, what a puny thing is a tiger’s tooth
or claw compared to a big knife!</p>

<p>True it is that when a tiger finds a man
unready and alone, he can kill him as easily as a
man can kill a chicken. But in the course of ages
he has acquired an instinctive horror of men, weak
as they are, such as men, in turn, have of snakes.
The unknown seems infinite, to tigers as to men.
A dog has its teeth, a deer or bull its horns; but
when a crowd of men are coming at him with a
noise like a cyclone, a tiger cannot tell what to
expect. So, even if you were a tiger, with a man’s
intellect to illumine the aspect of things in general,
you would often feel along with it that the better
part of valour is discretion.</p>

<p>It is not easy to think in the skin of a tiger. It
is easier to realise the effect of the sound of
humanity upon a tiger’s nerves by watching him and
the beaters. The matter is not one upon which there
is any difference of opinion possible. This said,
nothing perhaps could make the truth so palpable
to happy stay-at-homes as a reminiscence I
recently heard from a brave European officer who
has had experience as a hunter.</p>

<p><a name="pg_71" id="pg_71" href="#pg_71"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>71<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>For obvious reasons I will omit details that
might enable others to identify him against his
will. Suffice it to say, the scene was “in darkest
Burma,” and the time about the end of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>“You know,” said he, “the noise that the tiger
makes in going through kaing grass.”</p>

<p>But readers in general cannot know that. So
it may be explained. In the woods the tiger
glides gently, and steps unheard upon dry leaves
a man could not touch without a noise. He
realises the ideal of good children—to be seen
without being heard. It is not that he likes to be
seen. He is of a retiring disposition, and prefers
to be unnoticed so much so that even if you
frequent his haunts you are not likely to see him
more than once or twice in a lifetime, though you
may comfort yourself—if it is a comfort—by
reflecting that he doubtless sees you oftener. He
may be a neighbour of yours all his life; as a cub,
he may be fed upon your cattle, and, as a grown-up
tiger, help himself to the same, without once
showing his face or letting you hear his stealthy
step. He comes and goes like a thief in the night,
and if by rarest chance he walks by day it is on
silent pads more noiseless than the best of rubber
tyres. But the kaing grass reeds in swampy parts
<a name="pg_72" id="pg_72" href="#pg_72"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>72<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of Burma grow thick and high. They are seldom
less than a man’s height, and sometimes so high
as to overtop a man on horseback, and too thick
for a dog to get through. When the tiger is
hunting there he has to lie in wait by the sides of
the paths. I hesitate to believe what is sometimes
said—that he never is noiseless in the kaing—but
the evidence is overwhelming that he often
goes through it “as loudly as a cart,” say some
who have heard him, as they waited for him over
a kill, or, in one instance, over a calf tied up as
a bait.</p>

<p>“The noise is not the <em>same</em> as a cart’s, only as
loud. It seems to be unmistakable if once you
have heard it,” said the hunter, whose experience
is to be told. “There is a crackling swish—swish,
as he crumples up the reeds at every stride.
Think of my feelings when I heard it again
coming at me as I was walking back to camp
along the narrow footpath, with the reeds towering
above me, as if shutting out all help, to hide
you and drown your voice. Oh, my God!” The
man was speaking years afterwards, and
shuddered still. “It made me feel queer, I tell you,”
he went on. “I was paralysed till I remembered
what to do. Then didn’t I howl, ‘Thank God!’
and yell! and swear! Somehow you don’t recall,
<a name="pg_73" id="pg_73" href="#pg_73"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at such a time, what you say at church. The
tiger might have digested me before I could have
repeated a prayer. But every particle of
profanity, English, Burmese and Hindustani, that
ever was in my head came out then with a howl.
I didn’t care what it was if it made a noise.”</p>

<p>The curious listener, on history intent, tried to
refresh his memory by leading questions, but he
positively blushed at the recollection, and was as
shy as a girl. He proceeded:</p>

<p>“I kept it up, you know—I had to, although
I heard the sound draw back a little. It’s no joke
to have to bluff a tiger in the kaing grass and in
the dark, when you cannot see but know he can,
and may have his eye upon you. I never stopped
the noise. I felt he might spring upon me if it
slacked for a second. And when I could not
think of any other oath I struck up singing....”
And, in short, he emerged from the darkness
into the flickering glare of the camp-fire, yelling
“Rule, Brittania!” much louder than he ever sang
before.</p>

 />THE TIGER AT THE RIFLE-RANGE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap-A"><span class="uc">About</span> 1891 a tiger began levying taxes on
the little town of Shwegyin (Shwayjeen),
in Lower Burma, where the Shwegyin river joins
the big Sittang. The people were used to
leopards, but tigers had ceased from troubling
them so long that, as one said, “you might as
well try to persuade us that the dead had arisen
as that tigers had come back.” As there had
always been tigers in the adjoining mountains, and
the forest spread over the country, and touched
the town on every side but where the rivers ran,
this prejudice would have been surprising, if it had
not been so very human. It is hard to persuade
men of what they do not like. The people of
Shwegyin were not to be talked out of their
comfortable security. No words could persuade
them to look out for tiger, but the deeds of the
beast itself gradually did.</p>

<p>Though tigers and leopards alike are earnest
tariff reformers, their schedules differ in details,
<a name="pg_75" id="pg_75" href="#pg_75"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>75<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and as week succeeded week, and the dogs, so
dear to leopards, were steadily neglected, and the
invisible enemy, hovering around the herds coming
home carelessly, anyhow, in the twilight, took
calves and cows and bullocks, as they chanced to
stray and offer themselves, in a style no Burman
leopard ever tries, its capacity for great destruction
was allowed to prove its greatness, and the most
prejudiced of the local elders was at last candid
enough to say, “I fear I may have to admit it to
be a tiger when it is dead and I see it.”</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Municipal Committee the
president mentioned, adding the losses reported,
that the depredations in three months amounted
to more than half a year’s taxes on the town.
Like other oppressors, it destroyed a great deal
more than it needed.</p>

<p>The members groaned in chorus, especially
those who had cattle. But one who had no such
possessions remained cheerful and broke the
silence, saying, “It will die some day.”</p>

<p>A fellow-member who had had losses glared
at the speaker, who was remarkably obese, and
said, “If the tiger only knew how much better
eating some fat men in our town would make,
he might be persuaded to change his diet. I
wish he would.”</p>

<p><a name="pg_76" id="pg_76" href="#pg_76"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>76<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“I never go out at night,” said the obese one,
hastily, growing grave, whereat the others laughed,
and, recovering his composure, he continued:
“Tigers come and tigers go, but the taxes go
on for ever. When one official goes, another
comes.” Receiving the expected murmur of
applause, he added, “That’s what I was going
to say.”</p>

<p>It should perhaps be remarked that officials
in Burma are proverbially classed with thieves
and similar afflictions. We must remember that
the civilisation of Burma is older than that of
England, and should not be angry when the
people there smile at those of us who are simple
enough to suppose ourselves anything better
than an expensive nuisance.</p>

<p>“Of two equal taxes,” a Socratic member
asked, “which do you feel the more—the first you
pay, or the second?”</p>

<p>“The second.”</p>

<p>“And the second or the third?”</p>

<p>“The third.”</p>

<p>“And the third or a fourth?”</p>

<p>Then all became eloquent simultaneously, lest
an addition to the taxes might be in
contemplation.</p>

<p>The conclusion was unanimous that the last
<a name="pg_77" id="pg_77" href="#pg_77"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>tax was ever the worst, and the tiger’s inflictions
the hardest of all to bear. This emboldened a
sufferer to propose a levy, and municipal
compensation to losers—a proposal which his fellow-members
declared to be impracticable. There
was no lack of sympathy when details were told.
Even the obese member remarked, with unaffected
emphasis, “I was very sorry for Mother Silver
when she lost a cow.” And another fatality
was told, and another, and another. If they
could have compassed the tiger’s death by voting,
it would have quickly died.</p>

<p>It did not die. A vote is seldom more than
a good resolution. Deeds always need a doer.
The most a vote can do is to ensure the worker
elbow-room, and in this instance it was superfluous.
Nobody wanted to spare the tiger. How
to catch it was the problem. Its ravages were
imputed to the English government, which had
been confiscating arms. So the Deputy
Commissioner lent guns and gave out ammunition
gratis. But still the tiger flourished.</p>

<p>In vain did men spend nights in trees, “sitting
up over a kill,” as they expressed it. It never
returned to cold meat. Why should it, with
plenty of fresh cattle available? In vain did
they study the ways it went, and sit in ambush.
<a name="pg_78" id="pg_78" href="#pg_78"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>There was an infinite variety about it. It never
repeated a catch in the same place and way.
To describe completely all its doings, and the
plans that <em>failed</em> to catch it, would fill a book.</p>

<p>At an early period of its history the people
began to fetch the cattle home by daylight; but
that simple device did not defeat it long. True,
it loved the darkness better than the light, and
the herds came home undiminished. But the tiger
was not to be driven back to a lighter diet so
easily. He followed his food. The cattle
disappeared in the dark from pens and sheds, and
tell-tale marks proclaimed that the thief was the
enemy with four big legs and ugly claws.</p>

<p>At times there was an intermission of some
weeks, long enough to let everyone grow careless
again. But it had only gone to the hills, most
probably as people go to Carlsbad, to rest its
digestive organs. Then it returned to business
with appetite refreshed, a very hungry tiger.
People began to speak of it with bated breath
and shows of humbleness, as an Englishman talks
of a lord or a German of an emperor. That feeling
grew to a superstitious dread. This was clearly
more than an ordinary tiger.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is a tigress with a litter of hungry
kittens,” was a matter-of-fact suggestion, received
<a name="pg_79" id="pg_79" href="#pg_79"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>79<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with a shudder, as if it had been disrespectful,
a kind of lese-majesty. Besides, the suggestion
was at last seen to be wrong, for once at last,
once only, and then only after it had killed its
scores, it was seen. A man was riding in the
moonlight along the lonely boundary road, and
saw it stride across the road, and sit down on the
farther side, as if to wait to see him pass. It
did not crouch. It sat up squarely, like a cat at
home. It raised its head as high as possible,
as if to enjoy the coolness of the evening breeze,
which was as welcome to the tiger as to any
European. On sight of it the rider’s Arab
mare began to dance, and turned again and again
to bolt backwards. This saved Mr Stripes, for
the rider, though apparently unarmed, had a pistol
in his pocket, and had taken it out and was
preparing to empty it as he galloped past. But
the mare would not go nearer than 30 yards.
The tiger became tired of watching her pirouetting,
and stood up as if to depart. The rider
fired, and at the sound of the shot, which missed,
the tiger slouched swiftly into the woods unharmed,
and gave no time for a second shot. When the
man arrived at his house, a mile away, he found
five other men at his gate, waiting for him, and
saying, “Come with us. He” (there was no need
<a name="pg_80" id="pg_80" href="#pg_80"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to be more explicit) “is slaughtering now on the
inner side of this road. We know where he’ll
cross it, and are going to ambuscade him.”</p>

<p>“No use!” was the reply. “I have just seen
him pass.” They went to see if they had guessed
aright. But no! The spot they meant to
ambuscade was half a mile from the actual
crossing-place.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only man in the town who had a
gun and did not hunt that tiger was the Sergeant-Instructor,
a solitary representative of the British
army, stationed in Shwegyin to drill the volunteers.
And the reason why he did not go a-hunting, as
everybody knew, was that Mrs Sergeant-Instructor
had announced that she would go with him.</p>

<p>She meant it too. “Another lady” in the
station had sat up with her husband. Why
should she not do likewise? If a tiger fight had
been the kind of thing she supposed, such as
might be shown in a circus or a tournament, she
would have made a magnificent second to her
gallant husband, and so he admitted. If only the
tiger would come openly to their door in daylight,
“instead of skulking in the dark round about,
like a coward,” as I believe she said, Mrs Sergeant-Instructor
would have done her duty, and probably
a good deal more. And she undoubtedly was
<a name="pg_81" id="pg_81" href="#pg_81"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>disgusted with “the man’s poor spirit.” But
every man in the station knew better. As an
officer whispered to me: “What would be the use
of the man sitting up with Mrs Sergeant-Instructor?
She could not hold her tongue five
minutes, not to speak of hours.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was chaff enough at first,
which it was hard for him to bear until, in time,
the continual failures of experienced hunters,
magistrates and foresters, policemen and soldiers
and others, became a consolation.</p>

<p>“Ah, the target is easier to see than a tiger,” he
would murmur, when scoring at the range.</p>

<p>The range was a clearing in the forest on low
ground, upon the municipal boundary, a clearing
of about 100 yards wide and 600 long.</p>

<p>One morning the Sergeant-Instructor went to
it alone, with a rifle in his hand and two or three
cartridges in his pocket. “As a kind of object
for the morning’s walk,” he explained, “I meant
to fire a shot at the range, to make sure I had got
the rifle springs right. It was a bit stiff last
Sunday. I had been working at it, to diminish
the pull-off.”</p>

<p>As you descend to the range from the main
road, you first arrive at the 600 yards’ station, the
butts being at the farthest end; and this morning,
<a name="pg_82" id="pg_82" href="#pg_82"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>82<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“seeing all clear,” said he, “I just lay down at
600 yards, and decided to take the shot from
there, without going any farther.</p>

<p>“So I shifted about as usual, till I was lying
comfortably, and adjusted my sights, and took
aim; and then, just before pulling the trigger, I
cast my eyes to windward, to the left as it
happened, to see what the trees were like, and
whether my allowance for the breeze was right.
As I was looking at the trees on my left, I saw
the tiger come out and walk across the range, to
go between me and the target. I was glad there
was nobody there. There was no time to talk.
It did not hurry, so to speak, but went fast over
the ground, fast and straight, like a man going to
catch a train, with no time to lose, but too big a
bug to run—you know the kind of thing.”</p>

<p>“Like a man going over a level-crossing?”</p>

<p>“You might say that, but he did not look up
and down. He stared straight in front of him,
and I am sure he did not see me at all, or look to
see anything on either side.”</p>

<p>“Like the ideal Christian pilgrim, not looking
right or left?”</p>

<p>The Sergeant seemed puzzled. He had not
noticed anything pious about it. So I tried
again.</p>

<p><a name="pg_83" id="pg_83" href="#pg_83"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>83<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“Like a dog after game? Perhaps he was
after something?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, that’s it. I’m sure he had sport in
sight.”</p>

<p>“Preoccupied, so to speak?”</p>

<p>“Very much so. You know there are always
cattle grazing on the far side of the range. He
was hard at them. I just had time to shoot and
no more. I noticed he would cross at 300 yards,
and, doing everything as fast as I could, I lowered
my sights, and aimed, and fired. He dropped,
and never moved, and ... here he <span class="nw">is....”</span></p>

<p>It had been a fine tiger, in the prime of life;
and, as doctors say after a post-mortem, the corpse
had all the appearance of having been extremely
well nourished. Death was the result of a sudden
failure of the heart’s action, due to violence.</p>

<p>The Sergeant-Instructor had scored a bull’s-eye.</p>

 />A LESSON FROM THE WATER BUFFALO</h2>


<h3 title="1. The Buffalo and the Skunk">1. THE BUFFALO AND THE SKUNK</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">When</span> the Philippinos tell you now of the
swagger of the Spaniards, which was the
sorest of the sorrows that drove them into revolt,
they often mention that the Spaniards called them
“water buffaloes.”</p>

<p>“To call you geese would have been kind in
comparison?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite polite!”</p>

<p>Indeed the water buffalo known to us in Burma,
also, is not smart at all. Slow, heavy and dull,
amphibious in his habits, he moves like a very
fat pig, with almost less agility. Slipping through
the muddy slush, in the sleekness of his prime, he
looks almost “like a whale?” Yes, round enough
for that, and almost like a little whale, except for
his awkwardness, for his legs are not yet atrophied
or sea-changed, and he has only his legs to
move by; and also except—a big exception—his
huge horns. These are extended like the
<a name="pg_85" id="pg_85" href="#pg_85"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>arms of a gesticulating orator or other creature
that flings his arms wide and turns up his hands;
but never were arms flung out so gracefully as
those horns, with a sweep like that of a scythe or
scimitar, symmetrical and pointed. They lie on
the back, when the owner lifts its nose to sniff the
wind, harmless and out of the way, like a sword
in its sheath. There is nothing ornamental about
them, any more than about the Forth Bridge;
and yet so beautiful is fitness that perhaps no
bovine head has finer ornaments.</p>

<p>It always surprises one to see how cool the
beast remains with these exclamatory horns. But
it is these very horns that let him remain cool and
at leisure in the haunted woods. From tigers
down, all possible enemies are afraid of them.
So the Burman water buffalo never needs to
hasten; and, like a gentleman of independent
means, not needing to exert himself, grows slow.
His gait is dignified. His mind is dull.</p>

<p>This is not rhetorical conjecture, but natural
history. Every healthy, living organism is
harmonious, meaning all of a piece, such as men try
to make their pictures and songs, and everything
else they want to make well; and this particular
collocation of cause and effect might be illustrated
and proved by many modern instances.</p>

<p><a name="pg_86" id="pg_86" href="#pg_86"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>86<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Not to be offensive to our fellow-men, who in
every country exhibit the same tendency; averting
our gaze from all who are happy in “having
something else than their brains to depend upon”;
avoiding politics, which is a legitimate field of
natural history, but obscured by vapours which
make observation difficult, let us take the skunk—not
meaning any kind of men, who are really
miscalled skunks, for they have none of the beast’s
qualities but one, and in general have the nimbleness
of rats—let us come among the animals and
candidly consider the four-legged skunk.</p>

<p>He is a little beast, no bigger than a house cat,
and lives, as puss would do in the woods, on worms
and insects and mice and birds and such small game.
But he is not nimble, like the cat, or fox, or any
other hunting and hunted creature. He is as
leisurely as the water buffalo, and as careless of
observation in the wildest country as a dog in a
farmer’s yard. However hungry, the bigger beasts
of prey, whose natural food he might seem to be,
prefer to leave him alone. The fact is that he
can make himself be smelt in a sickening way for
nearly a mile off; and so “the skunk,” according
to an observer, “goes leisurely along, holding
up his white tail as a danger-flag, for none to
come within range of his nauseous artillery.”</p>

<p><a name="pg_87" id="pg_87" href="#pg_87"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>87<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“Call me a skunk?” a man might say, “I
wish I were, sometimes.” There is perhaps no
kind of life that is not worth living; so we need
not wonder that there is something to envy in the
skunk. The water buffalo is a perfect gentleman,
compared to him; but the same security against
enemies has produced in both the same leisurely
habits. The horns protect the buffalo, and are
at once his weapon and his danger-flag.</p>


<h3 title="2. Hunting the Buffalo">2. HUNTING THE BUFFALO</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">On</span> the last day of 1908, in a morning walk at
Myaungmya, Lower Burma, I met two
acquaintances, Messrs Dunn and M‘Kenzie, riding
home. They had elected to enjoy their Christmas
holidays a-hunting, and been away for several days.</p>

<p>“Hunting what?”</p>

<p>“Buffalo.”</p>

<p>“I believe the buffalo is a dangerous beast to
tackle.”</p>

<p>They looked at each other in a way that showed
they had an adventure to tell. They had gone
with another European and a crowd of followers
to a muddy island in the delta, where a wild bull
buffalo lived. They had failed to find him, and
were all walking carelessly away, when he accidentally
<a name="pg_88" id="pg_88" href="#pg_88"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>88<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>met them. The sight of a mob where
he had lived alone, like Robinson Crusoe,
startled the old bull, and he charged. Then
magistrates, policemen and followers stampeded
in many directions. With the instinct inherited
from our forgotten arboreal ancestors, the fugitives
sought refuge in the trees; but the trees were too
small to lift them above the reach of the horns,
and one or more would have been killed if Mr
Dunn had not stumbled and fallen in the mud.
This stopped the buffalo, which tried to pick him
up, but could not do it, as he had the sense to lie
flat. So it passed on; and Dunn then crawled to
where his servant had dropped his gun, and recovered
it, and shot the buffalo.</p>


<h3 title="3. Taming the Buffalo">3. TAMING THE BUFFALO</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">This</span> adventure shows how easily lives might
be lost in hunting the wild buffalo, about
which the herdsmen who know him best have
told me what should, perhaps, be better known,
were it only to prevent misunderstandings. There
is not the slightest need for war between buffaloes
and us. They are not natural enemies, like the
tiger. They are not even troublesome to tame,
like the deer.</p>

<p><a name="pg_89" id="pg_89" href="#pg_89"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>89<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“Though terrible to kill, they are easy to catch,”
say the herdsmen familiar with their haunts. “You
have only to decoy them into a pen, and once there
they can sell for a price at once, like those born in the
village. They are more valuable,” said one herdsman.</p>

<p>“But the taming?”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing. Let them starve till they are
weak. Then feed them up, slowly. Make them
feel they are being fed by men.”</p>

<p>“They can see that.”</p>

<p>“No, for you generally bandage their eyes. You
have to speak to them and not leave them to eat
as if they found the food themselves. Let them
know they owe it to you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think of that at all,” said another
man. “Neither do they. This is what happens.
There’s generally a lot of them, like a herd. Some
would be dead, before others were weak. If you
just flung the food in anyhow, the weaklings would
be the last to get it. You keep an eye on them,
so as not to lose any; and whenever you see that
one is weak, you feed that one.”</p>

<p>“It comes to the same thing,” rejoined the man
who spoke first. “They learn that men are their
friends, and then they’ll do anything you want.”</p>

<p>“Do they work willingly?”</p>

<p>“Who ever did? They do what they have to, like
<a name="pg_90" id="pg_90" href="#pg_90"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>other people. A buffalo is so mighty that he hardly
needs to make an effort to pull the plough. The one
new caught and tamed does as well as the rest.”</p>

<p>“Why is he worth more?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t,” said the other man, quoting figures.
An argument followed, and in the end they agreed.
A newly-tamed herd might sell for less per head
than village-born cattle, if the wild ones caught
included more old animals and calves. Compare
contemporaries, and the wild one is the better.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>Various reasons were suggested, including one
that was oddly expressed. “The wild animal is the
more vigorous, because he has never been spoiled
by working. Think how different I would have
been if I had never had to work for my living!”</p>

<p>This was absurd. Till we came here, with our
commercial creed that money makes the man,
education in Burma was universal and free to the
poor, and, however it be in England, where factory
workers breed in slums and breathe polluted air, in
Burma the working man lives mostly in the fields,
and is sturdier, and often more sensible, than the
idler. The herdsmen reluctantly admitted this;
and it led to a digression.</p>

<p>In a Socratic way, I explained the gospel of
work, with half-and-half acceptance as long as I
<a name="pg_91" id="pg_91" href="#pg_91"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>91<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>quoted only Chinese maxims and examples; but,
happening to hint that the English also had that
to teach the East, I spoiled the lesson. There was
a general laugh. “When do the English work?”
Then one asked the other: ”Did you ever see an
Englishman working?” They said to each other
that the only Englishmen who worked were one
or two, whom the others did not speak to, but
treated like the Pagoda-slaves of native Burma.
We returned to the buffaloes.</p>

<p>“Why is the wild one the better?”</p>

<p>“He is stronger, and fresher, and quieter.”</p>

<p>“Quieter?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He thinks of men, women and children
as his feeders, and will never hurt anybody, and a
little child can lead him.”</p>

<p>“A child can drive the village cattle.”</p>

<p>“The wild ones tamed are safest of all.” (It
should be noted that the domestic buffalo is
dangerous occasionally, and people are sometimes
hurt or killed by them.)</p>

<p>“Don’t they notice that men caught them?”</p>

<p>“They’re not clever enough for that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they try to escape?”</p>

<p>“Never. Why should they? They have all
they want. It is our business to keep them
contented, and it’s easy.”</p>

<p><a name="pg_92" id="pg_92" href="#pg_92"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>92<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“Their calves are at times obstreperous,” a man
added, after a pause, and the others agreed, but
said, “All you need do, at the worst, is to cut
their horns, that is, cut off the tips.”</p>

<p>“Why not do that to all the calves? There’s somebody
killed or hurt by buffaloes every year in Burma.”</p>

<p>“The glory of a buffalo is his horns. It would
be wrong, because it would not be natural to blunt
them. We would never do it unless we could not
help it, when a particular beast is bad.”</p>

<p>“It’s too much bother, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s easy. But it does not look natural.
The buffalo with his horns blunted is disfigured,
and seems to feel it.”</p>

<p>“No, no, it’s not natural at all,” said one after
the other, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“How do you hunt the buffalo?”</p>

<p>“We never hunt the buffalo. No Burman ever
did. At any rate, none ever does now. It is
much safer and easier to catch and tame them;
and it pays better.”</p>

<p>A buffalo went by as our talk was ending; and
on its withers was sitting a little boy of six or
seven years of age, drumming merrily on its broad
neck with his heels. At sight of us, he signified
to it, by slaps and shouts, to move aside, so as not
to splash us; and the big buffalo gently obeyed.</p>

 />THE BUFFALO AND THE CROCODILE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">When</span> the rains have all run off, and the
snows of Central Asia have not begun to
melt, about the middle of the dry weather, the
Irrawaddy, our Burman Mississippi, runs its
lowest; and in such places as Magwe, a district
on the road to Mandalay, the sandbanks are
conspicuous. In 1894 there was, as there often
is, a sandbank in Magwe district that, starting
from the eastern bank, like a dam, athwart the
current, bent down the stream, like a breakwater
at sea, enclosing a natural harbour between
it and the bank. This little harbour was shoaled
at its southern or open end by the silting sands
in the water eddying there; but for most of its
length it was deep enough to be as comfortable
for the cattle as if the whole enclosure had been
made for their convenience.</p>

<p>It was all a big buffalo-wallow one afternoon
that year (1894). One after another, scores
of long-horned buffaloes had subsided into it, like
<a name="pg_94" id="pg_94" href="#pg_94"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>94<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>submarines, leaving little but their nostrils on
the surface. Men and women stood about on the
bank, and children were bathing at the water’s edge.
Suddenly a splashing drew all eyes. It takes
much to excite a buffalo. Even their manner of
fighting is more than elephantine. I stood and
watched a duel among them lately (1908), but
never will again. It was perhaps the most
leisurely battle that human being could endure to
watch. But there, in 1894, men stared in wonder
at a huge cow-buffalo splashing distractedly southwards
from the extreme upper end of the pool.
They soon saw she was chasing a crocodile that
was carrying off her calf. Finding herself
distanced in the water, she took to the shore, and
galloped like a cart-horse in a hurry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said an onlooker, “whether
we could have reached the shoal in time to be of
any use, but when we saw the old cow going like
that, we thought it best to stand aside.”</p>

<p>This was wise. The buffalo is enormous, and
might easily kill a man by inadvertence, and a
big crocodile, such as they said this was, though
not so overwhelming, is otherwise dangerous.
It does not seem to have been ascertained how
old a crocodile can be. It seems to live to a
great age, once it passes safely through the
<a name="pg_95" id="pg_95" href="#pg_95"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>95<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dangers of adolescence, and to continue growing
bigger the longer it lives, like a tree. In Arakan
I had seen some Indian coins that had ceased to
be current for about a century, and were then,
in 1893, recovered from the stomach of a patriarchal
crocodile. The likeliest guess was that he
had got this trouble in his stomach—for such it
probably was to him—by eating one of the
corpses that furnished such plenteous feeding to
his tribe in the wars in Arakan, more than a
century before. There was nothing certain, of
course, except the age of the coins and the fact
that they were found in his stomach, and he
might have eaten another beast that had eaten
the corpse, or he might have recently dined upon
an Arakanese archæologist, but it is at least as
likely that he had been suffering—if he suffered—a
hundred years, for the headlong gluttony of youth.</p>

<p>A Sanskrit proverb runs:</p>

<p>They had not to wait long.</p>

<p>“It was the nicest thing I ever saw in my
<a name="pg_96" id="pg_96" href="#pg_96"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>life,” said a man to me, his voice almost trembling
with enthusiasm months afterwards. “I never
heard tell of a thing like it. She went along the
bank like a dog, in spite of her size. We ran to
see better. Some say she made for the water,
when she came abreast of the crocodile, but seeing
the crocodile go by, drew back and galloped on
again. I did not see that. We all saw the
finish. She took the water at the shoal and
stood waiting, like a cat. Of course the cattle
knew the place, but fancy the old cow reflecting
that the crocodile would need to cross the shoal
to reach deep water.</p>

<p>“At first, while she stood waiting, we thought
she was too late, as the enemy had gone below
the surface, but soon we saw the stiff-necked
crocodile, not looking round, slowly dragging the
calf and itself over the sand, in front of the old
cow. Ha, ha! She waited for the right moment,
just like a cat; then charged, like a buffalo; and
then we saw the great crocodile wriggling high in
the air, spitted and tossed as easily as if it had
been only a puppy. The horns both went clean
through the middle of its body, and came out again.”</p>

<p>I forget the fate of the calf, but they told me the
taste of the crocodile’s flesh. The nicest bits were
near the tail. So I know that the crocodile died.</p>

 />A NEST OF CROCODILES</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">In</span> 1893 and 1894 I was Deputy Commissioner
of Kyaukpyu district, which means the islands
of Ramri and Cheduba, and smaller isles adjoining,
and an adjacent strip of the malarious coast of
Arakan. The headquarters was in the north of
Ramri, and, sitting in my house there, one evening
early in 1894, I heard an unusual clamour at the
door. There was audibly somebody having an
altercation with my servants.</p>

<p>I went to see and hear. It was a fisherman
from a far-off corner of the district. Till shortly
before then the Government had paid rewards for
the destruction of crocodiles and their eggs; and
so this man, on finding a nest of crocodile’s eggs,
put them in a bushel basket and started with it
for headquarters. He was nearly there before he
heard that these eggs were no more paid for.
Loath to lose his labour, he finished his journey
and tried to sell them in the bazaar. There was a
sensation. He had to run.</p>

<p><a name="pg_98" id="pg_98" href="#pg_98"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>98<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The people cried to him that he must not sleep
in the town till he got rid of them. “Fling them
into the sea,” they said; but he was most
unwilling. “Hope springs eternal in the human
breast.” Perhaps it was a lie that rewards were
no longer paid? One never can tell what to
believe. He decided to try to speak to the
Deputy Commissioner before flinging the eggs
away.</p>

<p>I heard his story, and told him it was true that
rewards were paid no more; but I pitied the man
and bought the nest from him, basket and all,
paying him liberally. It is needful to mention
the liberality of the payment to explain what
followed.</p>

<p>“Take it upstairs.”</p>

<p>The servants were men, of course, not women;
yet they shuddered and drew back, each pushing
another forward.</p>

<p>“I’ll carry it for you!” cried the happy fisherman;
“is it into the bedroom you want me to
take it?”</p>

<p>“Put it on the front verandah.”</p>

<p>The servants surveyed it from a distance. The
eggs were in colour like hen’s eggs, and about
twice the size. They were longer, but hardly at
all thicker, and peculiar only in being of the same
<a name="pg_99" id="pg_99" href="#pg_99"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>99<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>size at both ends. Some scores of them were
embedded in mud, with roots of reeds and grass;
but there is no reason to suppose, as has been
done, that the crocodile which laid the eggs had
mixed the grasses with the mud. How could she,
stiff-necked as she is, and unhandy? The mud
so mixed would be the readiest available where
the eggs were laid, between wind and water in a
shallow tidal creek. That was where the fisherman
said that he found them. The heat of the
sun is what hatches them. Part of the day they
lie bare to it or almost bare, and for the rest of the
time they are covered by water which the sun has
warmed. In such an incubator the heat of the
rotting grass would matter no more than a lucifer
match in a furnace. Of course, all life does hang
upon the sun, but the unhatched crocodiles depend
on it directly, and might make out a better title to
celestial parentage than anyone I know, not even
excepting the Emperor of Japan.</p>

<p>The servants remained alarmed. It was
probably at their instigation that a carpenter came to
see if he was not wanted to make a wooden wall
to screen the verandah where the eggs were from
the rest of the house. When bidden make
anything he liked, if willing to be paid for it by two or
three young crocodiles, he hastily retreated. The
<a name="pg_100" id="pg_100" href="#pg_100"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>beasts have a bad name in Arakan. There, as in
Egypt, they do eat people occasionally, but there
is nothing else against them.</p>

<p>Another device of the servants was to keep the
dogs beside the nest and feed them there. “To
give us warning when the crocodiles come out,”
they said, “so that we may let you know.”
There was no doubt that the little dears were on
their way—too far on their way to let me blow any
of the eggs successfully. I did blow one or two,
but the holes made by the departing contents were
too big. The shells were not worth keeping.</p>

<p>The dogs were not needed after all. A number
of visitors were sitting and standing around the
nest on the morning when the great moment
came, and the eggs atop began to open like popcorns.
From every opening shell there leapt a
baby crocodile, span-long but perfect, as nimble
as a rat and desperately hungry. No wonder!
Think of the food they needed to swell them to
the size of their mighty parent.</p>

<p>It was difficult to study them. Whatever noise
they made was drowned in the clamour of the
visitors and servants; and they themselves, to the
number of about half a dozen, were soon drowned
in whisky, as the best substitute for the spirits of
wine which had not arrived. Their little corpses
<a name="pg_101" id="pg_101" href="#pg_101"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>101<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>may still be seen in Glasgow Museum, I suppose.
At least, I sent them to it for a sepulchre. The
rest, and all their unhatched brethren, found a
more common grave in a hole that was ready for
them in the garden.</p>

<p>I was very sorry to have to do this; but I had
to be at office at 10 a.m., and if this had not been
done before I went, I would have found my house
desolate on my return, and no dinner ready. My
servants would have fled unanimously. So the
poor little crocodiles had to die. But it was
humanely done, and the unhatched eggs were broken
before being buried, and the earth rammed tight.</p>

<p>“Stand and see the man does it,” I said to the
“boy” or factotum.</p>

<p>“You may be sure it’ll be done,” said he, and
added, with unusual cheerfulness, “we’ll all be
helping him.”</p>

<p>Though the lucky fisherman had been told to
say as little as possible, he had boasted so much of
his good fortune that a plain-spoken vernacular
proclamation had to be sent in all directions to
this <span class="nw">effect—</span></p>

<p class="ctr"><big><i>NOTICE</i><br
 />NESTS OF CROCODILES’ EGGS</big><br
 /><span class="smc">The Deputy Commissioner Does not Want any More</span></p>

<p><a name="pg_102" id="pg_102" href="#pg_102"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>102<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>There was a curious sequel a month or two
later. Somewhere about the south of Ramri
Island, there lived a secluded farmer of strong
intellect, who asked himself, “Why did the Deputy
Commissioner want to hatch crocodiles’ eggs?”
His neighbours were asking themselves the same
question, and to an interested gathering at a
Buddhist temple he explained his solution of the
conundrum.</p>

<p>“Why do we hatch the eggs of fowls? Because
we want fowls. Therefore it must have been
because he wanted crocodiles that the Deputy
Commissioner bought and hatched the crocodile’s
eggs.</p>

<p>“He probably did not know, as we do, that the
new-born crocodiles are untameable, like fishes.
They need a great deal of time to grow big. But
a full-grown crocodile is a very sagacious as well
as a very hungry animal, and it would quickly
become devoted to anybody who fed it as well as
he could afford to feed it. So, if he paid so much
for the eggs, he would give thousands of rupees for
a really big and mature crocodile, especially if it
were nicely tamed.”</p>

<p>The wisdom of this reasoning was much admired.
So the wise fellow and his friends sought the
acquaintance of the dwellers in the creeks, and
<a name="pg_103" id="pg_103" href="#pg_103"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>103<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>decoyed into a little tank a patriarchal crocodile.
Some weeks were spent in “taming” it (and
dosing it with opium, as was afterwards
suspected). Then half a dozen men, no longer young,
shouldered the pole to which the crocodile was
tied, and carried it, more than a day’s journey, to
the district headquarters.</p>

<p>They came to the house of the Deputy
Commissioner about the middle of the second day
after leaving home, and were told he was at office.
They went to seek him.</p>

<p>He was on the bench, in court. Shrieks and
shouts and a wild stampede of people was
the informal announcement of the new arrival.
They stopped all business; but nothing stopped
them. Not knowing the way very well, they
began by entering the Treasury. The sentry
shouted and the guard turned out with fixed
bayonets and loaded rifles, in case this might
be a manœuvre for more easily rushing the
Treasury.</p>

<p>“We are fetching a live crocodile to the Deputy
Commissioner,” cried the newcomers to all who
would listen to them. Then it was supposed they
might have been sent for, and they were directed
to the court-rooms.</p>

<p>The bailiff rushed into court, and, looking
<a name="pg_104" id="pg_104" href="#pg_104"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>104<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>distracted, trembling and hardly able to articulate, he
<span class="nw">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Six men, with a great struggling crocodile
alive, on the verandah now, coming in, nothing can
stop them. They want to see the Deputy
Commissioner. I went for the Superintendent of
Police, but he is out. They won’t listen to me.”</p>

<p>I went out to them and had the beast carried
downstairs, and heard their story. There was no
possible room to doubt their good faith. Their
dream of a fortune, for such they expected, seemed
like the Arabian Nights.</p>

<p>I told them I did not want a crocodile, but that
as they had taken so much trouble I would pay
them out of my own pocket, for killing it, the
largest reward that Government used to pay.
This was like offering a pound or two to men who
looked for thousands. Of course they did not
thank me. I left them to finish the matter
themselves, and returned to business.</p>

<p>I was not to be quit of the crocodile so easily.
For more than an hour a crowd continued to
collect round the live monster as it lay on the
grassy sands between the court-house and the sea.
Then the bailiff returned to me more distracted
than ever.</p>

<p>“The men have decided to unbind the crocodile
<a name="pg_105" id="pg_105" href="#pg_105"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>105<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and leave it where it is, and depart. They say
they will not accept money as the price of blood.
This is a tamed crocodile. It is like a friend. If
it is dangerous now it is only because it is hungry.
So long as it is well fed it will hurt nobody.
They are not damned fishermen, nor damned
hunters.” (These adjectives were not used
profanely, but correctly, as it is the popular belief that
fishermen and hunters are damned.) “These men
say that they are respectable Buddhists and
cultivators. They would not kill a wild crocodile,
much less a tame one.”</p>

<p>“Put it in the sea.”</p>

<p>“I told them to do so, but they said it wouldn’t
go.”</p>

<p>“Bid them carry it to the creek a mile away.”</p>

<p>The bailiff asked whether the reward was to be
paid if it were let go in the creek, and thinking of
possible damage subsequently I answered “No.”</p>

<p>He returned to say, “The men declare that they
have carried it far enough already. They’ve done
enough for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Then leave it bound.”</p>

<p>“They want their ropes and pole.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take its blood upon my head. Call a man
from the Treasury guard to shoot it. Let them
fling its carcass into the sea and pay them then.”</p>

<p><a name="pg_106" id="pg_106" href="#pg_106"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>106<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>To this they agreed, it was reported; and,
fearing some accident to the crowd, in the absence
of the Superintendent of Police, I went to see the
killing rightly done.</p>

<p>There was difficulty in getting people to move
out of danger. So one of the men knelt beside
the crocodile unbidden, and, with a knowing look,
full of suppressed fun, he cut the strings that held
the jaws together and some of the other ropes.</p>

<p>Slowly the crocodile moved and opened wide
the greatest mouth I ever beheld—something
suggestive of the “Jaws of Hell.” The crowd
shrieked and dispersed to a distance. Then the
crocodile died. His bearers received the promised
money, the fishes ate his body, and his blood is
upon my head.</p>

 />USEFUL SNAKES</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">In</span> the backwoods of Thayetmyo district,
Burma, in 1886, I was next to the man who
was guiding a party of policemen and villagers
going, in single file, on the track of robbers in
arms, who had been cattle-lifting. Suddenly the
guide in front held his hand behind his back as
a signal to stop, and I passed on the signal.</p>

<p>The guide began to move forward, on his
toes, as noiselessly as a cat, towards something
on the ground. His eyes were riveted upon it,
20 or 30 feet in front of him. To the rest of
the party it was invisible. The only noise was
the flick of a hand on a pony’s neck, removing a
horsefly; and even that was stopped, and all
was hushed. We seemed to hold our breath,
and, though the guide was moving as quick as
man could move without a noise, he seemed to
be creeping slowly, slowly. He lifted up his
arms as he came near his object, and then dived
forward, so to speak, not losing his balance, but
<a name="pg_108" id="pg_108" href="#pg_108"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>108<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>taking a great step and stooping, and recovering
himself with equal speed. Then we saw his
game. He had caught by the tail a long snake,
5 or 6 feet long, and was whirling it in the air.</p>

<p>It was thrilling to see it writhing in vain resistance
to the laws of matter and the tendency
called centrifugal. Its wriggling ended after two
or three thwacks of its head upon the ground;
but, long after it was as limp as a whipcord, he
went on twirling it and thwacking it. He
reminded me of the Scottish motto, “I mak’
siccar,” or “I make sure.” The legend is that
when Bruce had stabbed a traitor at Dumfries
and said to a henchman, “I think I have killed
him,” the henchman answered, “Think? I mak’
siccar,” and went and finished the killing. Our
guide was as resolute as he to make sure; but
after a while he held the limp thing at arm’s
length, and let it dangle a second or two in front
of him, undeniably dead. Then he flung it over
his shoulder and walked on in silence.</p>

<p>“Any use?” I cried.</p>

<p>“Curry for us all,” he answered, looking backwards
over his shoulder and seeming surprised
at the question.</p>

<p>In 1887, a few months later, being on the
Pegu Yoma Mountains between Toungoo and
<a name="pg_109" id="pg_109" href="#pg_109"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>109<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Thayetmyo, still on the same kind of business,
and leading a crowd of hungry men, I
remembered this, and shot a python more than
7 yards long and as thick as a man’s thigh.
We met each other accidentally, he and I. He
had been dozing after dinner, and yawned in
the finest old Piccadilly style. I sent an
unmannerly bullet into his mouth, which killed
him. For two days, at least, his flesh supplied
the wherewithal to flavour the rice of more than
forty men; but I cannot tell the taste of it. I
have eaten silkworms curried. They tasted
like shrimps. But if the reader wishes to realise
the savour of snakes, let him eat them himself.</p>

 />THE TUCKTOO</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Burma</span> is chiefly remarkable for a lizard
that occasionally haunts the trees and
houses there. Span-long or more, it has a head
big out of all proportion compared with others
of the lizard clans, and eyes that sometimes seem
to follow you like owl’s eyes, and a loud voice.
“Tuck-too!” it cries, “Tuck-too! Tuck-too!”
without any variation, except an occasional
repetition of the “oo-oo-oo” at the end, like a
musician tuning his pipes.</p>

<p>It is considered very lucky to have such a
lizard in your house; and as it is said to be fond
of baby rats, and rats bring plague, the prejudice
may have some foundation in fact. Its principal
food is insects—a wholesome appetite too; but
its great glory comes from the similarity of its
cry, weak in consonants and loud in vowels, <!-- original has duplicated "to" -->
to the Burmese for <i>Quite so</i>. It is a great prophet.
They say the rains can be foretold by counting
its <i>Quite sos</i>; and if you are about to wed you
<a name="pg_111" id="pg_111" href="#pg_111"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>111<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>should ask it, “Is she good? Is she bad?”
“Quite so, quite so,” says the prophet,
impartial as Fate. But perverse, let it stop first;
and if your last question to get “Quite so” is
the question,—“Is she bad?” you should break
off the marriage. They say that marriages have
been broken off on this account; and assuredly,
in many a village, you can see and hear the
children with mock gravity keeping time to the
tucktoo and crying in chorus,—“Is she good?
Is she bad?”</p>

<p>Sometimes, like other prophets, it comes to
church to speak, never to listen; and then it
may be loudly heard, to the joy of the
congregations rather than of the clergy. The rest of
its history has been embalmed in a song by one
of its <span class="nw">friends:—</span></p>

<h2 title="XVI. The Kitten’s Catch"><span class="chapnumber">XVI

 class="ns">[</span>113<span class="ns">]</span></span></a></span><br
 />THE KITTEN’S CATCH</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">He</span> is a common grey kitten; but he is the
last of a large family, and his mother is
devoted to him, and takes great pains about his
education. Now that he can run about, his mother
fetches indoors little field-mice for him, and baby
rats from the stable; and so the kitten is quickly
learning the trade of all his tribe. But mother
was digesting last night (11/6/09) and would not
run about with him, would only flick her tail; and
chasing mother’s tail became gradually
monotonous for a kitten that had had a field-mouse in
his paws, to say nothing of a baby rat.</p>

<p>So he went and spoke to the big fat frog that
was sitting in the corner of the dining-room, face
to the wall, like a pupil at school sent to stand
in the corner as a punishment. Only, the frog
was not being punished. He was catching flies.
He looked round at the kitten coming near
and trying to draw attention. He is a pot-bellied
frog, of elderly look, so that his leaping
<a name="pg_114" id="pg_114" href="#pg_114"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>114<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>seems out of character. On this occasion,
however, his deportment was unimpeachable. He
looked at the kitten earnestly, but never spoke,
moving nothing but his head, as he turned it round
to see him. He gazed at the importunate little
cat, as once a gaitered bishop gazed at a
newspaper-boy who wanted to speak to him, but
seemed unlikely to be polite. “I wish no ill to
you, but please leave me alone.” That was what
the frog’s look seemed to say; but he uttered no
sound. Perhaps he thought that talking might
disturb the flies he was catching, just as the gentle
angler sometimes prays for silence, lest a whisper
be heard by the fish.</p>

<p>The kitten took the hint and jumped upon a
chair and thence to the table, and walked across
it towards me. He is fond of me; that is to say,
he sometimes comes to me when he has nothing
else to do or wants something. But on the way
across the table he saw what seemed more interesting.
The brass Egyptian finger-bowl caught his
eye, and he surveyed it and its doily. He had
passed it unconcerned a few minutes before, but
that was when preoccupied about the frog. On
this occasion, after an attentive survey of the
finger-bowl, he put out his paw and tried to push
it sideways. It did not move. He tried a spring
<a name="pg_115" id="pg_115" href="#pg_115"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>115<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and a push, to add momentum to his muscle; and
so he shook it a little.</p>

<p>He raised himself to his full height and looked
and beheld something inside it, moving! Then
he became excited.</p>

<p>When you try to think like a cat, you must
begin by realising that he has fewer categories
than Aristotle. The universe is, in his mind,
divided into—<em>himself</em> and other things not-himself,
which is exactly the feline counterpart of
Hegel &amp; Co.’s Ego and Non-Ego; but, having
to find a living, the cat has passed as far beyond
the Hegelian stage as the Germans themselves
have done since Hegel died. He classifies things
not-himself into the Eatable and the Not-Eatable;
and again, a cross-division, into what he fears and
what he does not fear; and thirdly, another cross-division,
he distinguishes things that move from
things that do not move. Few hunting animals
are long of learning that last distinction; and yet
to know that motionless things escape the eye is
one of the first lessons that scouts have to be
taught. The kitten knew it. He flopped down
motionless a while, as soon as he saw something
moving inside the bowl; but men who have been
miseducated into believing without observing,
whose minds have been constricted by Greek
<a name="pg_116" id="pg_116" href="#pg_116"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>116<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>grammars and the rest, as the feet of Chinese
ladies are constricted by bandages, men of
bandaged brains, in short, still need to be taught
that in their maturity. Better late than never!</p>

<p>Stealthily the kitten now approached the bowl
and tried in vain to jerk out what was inside.
The bowl was too heavy for him. He crept
round and round it, and endeavoured to move it
by pulling the tablecloth, but failed again. Then
he sat down at a distance, with his head between
his paws, and watched it and considered, concentrating
his intellect upon it, exactly as a boy sits
down, with his arms round his head to puzzle out
a thing, retiring into himself, so that distracting
sights and sounds be held aloof, and only the
problem to be solved find access to his brain. It
is an excellent thing to make a <i xml:lang="lat" lang="lat">camera obscura</i>
of your skull in that way at times. I have
watched a great inventor doing it; and with like
admiration I now watched the kitten. No apology
is needed to my Brahman friends for mentioning
that this concentration is what they call “Yoga,”
described as “a discipline whereby the powers in
man are to be so trained that they will attain
their utmost development, and will realise and
respond to the subtlest and minutest influences
which bear on him from outside.” Such is ever
<a name="pg_117" id="pg_117" href="#pg_117"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>117<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the way of the wise; and it may be attempted by
the simple too, if they are sincere. It is conceit
and affectation that make the fool. The kitten
had no weakness of that kind. So he meditated
to some purpose; for he saw what to do.</p>

<p>He put out his paw and tugged the doily.
Hurrah! The bowl moved briskly. The hunt
was up now at the fifth tug the water flew out.
The triumphant kitten darted round the bowl to
catch his prey and found nothing. The tablecloth
was wet; but how could he connect the
wetness of the tablecloth with the thing that had
leapt from the bowl?</p>

<p>I tried to console him with milk, but he was
transported beyond the reach of sordid comforting.
Besides, he was not hungry. He returned
again and again to investigate the matter, till he
was tired. Where had the thing gone to? He
never guessed, and I could not tell him. Poor
little puss! For him, as for humanity, the ocean
of mystery, on which all things swim, is very close
at times.</p>

 />THE LEOPARD AS A KILLER OF MEN</h2>


<h3 title="1. Twice Twenty Years Ago or More">1. TWICE TWENTY YEARS AGO OR MORE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Not</span> long ago I read in Indian papers about
a leopard in Central India which had
killed about 173 men and women, and the carcass
of which showed fore-paws and chest muscles
of unusual size. “It had almost the front of a
tiger,” wrote one of the scribes. This was exactly
the description of another of the same kind,
which was told me about 1888 by Colonel Bingham,
then Conservator of Forests for an eastern division
of Burma. He beguiled the long evening in a
rest-house on the fringe of the woods by telling
me the life-history of a man-killing leopard in
Central India, which I believe he had hunted
there about twenty or thirty years before. It
made the “hours and minutes hand-in-hand go
by” so light that it was long, long after our
usual bed-time before we thought of looking at
our watches.</p>

<p><a name="pg_119" id="pg_119" href="#pg_119"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>119<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>If he had been the common story-teller, I could
never have kept awake, much less forgotten to
note the time. He was a man of accurate and
scientific tastes, and great knowledge of Natural
History, and, best of all, one of those rare
comfortable souls who are more interested in things
in general than in themselves. This makes
accuracy almost easy, and modesty comes without
an effort. We discussed at length the question
whether that leopard had been a cross between
the leopard and the tiger. The reports about
it had made Bingham think it must be so, but
the post-mortem upon it, at which I think he
assisted, made him dubious, for, to his surprise,
he found its markings purely leopard’s, and the
only difference between it and common leopards
to be its size, especially in front.</p>

<p>“After all,” I said, “the size is the chief
difference between leopards and common cats.”
Bingham agreed, and I found he was still of the
opinion that lions and tigers, leopards and jaguars,
are all more nearly related than at first sight
appears. He had been, as I then was, sanguine
about getting evidence that they interbred, and
while telling me he had never succeeded, thought
another might. Indeed it should be better
known that the chief difference between lions
<a name="pg_120" id="pg_120" href="#pg_120"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and tigers is the lion’s way of wearing his hair.
The difference in bone and muscle is less, much
less than there is between varieties of domestic
cats; and it is easy to exaggerate the specific
importance of colour. I know a worthy Dutchman
(Mr Hegt), who told me he acquainted
Charles Darwin with an interesting accouchement
of a lady-leopard in Holland. She brought forth
at a birth kits black and white, such as the
naturalists had till then classed as different
species. Darwin was delighted at the news.</p>

<p>The best part of our talk, however, was about
the leopard’s adventures. Bingham was not a
man to forget that the carcass cut up after death
is not the leopard. It is merely a confused
conglomerate of hide and flesh and bones and teeth
and claws, drenched in blood. Such things are
the mortal remains of the leopard; but its spirit,
the fire of life that made it terrible, that great
reality, whatever you call it, has fled away on
the wings of the wind. So fled the spirits of its
victims. Its fleshy garment lies before you as
helpless as ever were theirs, as harmless as if it
had been a sheep.</p>

<p>It was a little playful kitten in the forests, not
long before it became a terrible killer of men,
for its tribe grows fast. It took to killing as its
<a name="pg_121" id="pg_121" href="#pg_121"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>121<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>trade, like a fish to water. Its mother taught it
nothing else. When her milk ran dry, she taught
it how to flesh its baby fangs; and under her
kind, encouraging, maternal eyes it grew up big
and strong, and then it left its mother’s lair to
feed itself and live alone.</p>

<p>There is something thrilling in the strangeness
which such separation brings. The cat is a
tender mother, but she soon forgets her children.
A few months after parting, if this leopard and
its mother met in the woods, they would glare
at each other like strangers, without recognition.
If you doubt this, study your civilised domestic
cats, especially when they are hungry. The
matter is not doubtful.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the leopards eat each
other. As hawks do not peck out the eyes of
hawks, so leopards seek for tenderer beef than
that of leopards. Besides, their single aim in life
being to satisfy their appetites cheaply, to risk
a scratch would be bad business. So they
compete in the woods exactly as mercantile firms do
in the city, each grabbing all it can. They
generally die of starvation, but see nothing odd
in that. They have faced starvation all their
lives; and even when the mother-leopard comes
to perish so, there is no bitterness in her heart
<a name="pg_122" id="pg_122" href="#pg_122"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>122<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at the thought that it is her multitudinous kittens
that have made food scarce. She has forgotten
them. They have passed out of her mind
completely, like the shadows of the clouds that pass
across the surface of a mountain lake, and go by
and leave no sign.</p>


<h3 title="2. A Leopard that Loved the Ladies">2. A LEOPARD THAT LOVED THE LADIES</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Colonel Bingham</span> had not been able
to ascertain what made this leopard take
early to humanity. A guess that many favoured
was suggested by its life-long preference for
women. The guess was that its mother had
given her little ones some girls to flesh their
baby fangs upon. There had been some horrible
cases of that sort. One shudders to think of
girls in the maws of leopards, like the little mice
a tabby brings to her kittens. But, after all, many
a girl meets a worse fate in a European town.
The human beast of prey is crueller than any cat.</p>

<p>Whatever the explanation, the fact, at which
the Central Provinces of India soon were shuddering,
was that this great leopard grew into a man-eater,
that seemed to combine the strength and
stomach of the tiger and the wily familiarity of
the leopard. He took girls for choice. Of two
<a name="pg_123" id="pg_123" href="#pg_123"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>123<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>women returning with water from the well, the
one was taken and the other was left, that is to
say, ran screaming home. So marked was his
preference for their sex, that whenever he was
supposed to be near a village, the women all
became like purdanishin ladies, and would not
go out of doors.</p>

<p>I believe it was a police-officer, but it may
have been a “man in the forests,” who told
Bingham of being bothered by a nasty smell in
a mango grove in which he had pitched his tent.
They searched far and near for the cause of it
a long time, and at last discovered the putrid
half of a woman’s body, hidden in the foliage,
in a fork of a mango tree. The villagers said
they knew by what was left that it was the
remains of the leopard’s meal, for it had an Homeric
appreciation of entrails. The head was wanting,
and the arms too; but the legs were little more
than nibbled. About half the corpse had been
put aside for further recourse, if needed. It had
not been needed. The leopard must have found
another. Indeed, they said that it seldom needed
to dine upon cold meat.</p>

<p>It would often have had to do so, of course,
if it had limited itself to women; but it no more
thought of that than an epicure thinks of
<a name="pg_124" id="pg_124" href="#pg_124"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>124<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>restricting himself to turtle. The women were its
tit-bits; but they were so shy that it might often
have starved if it had taken nothing else.</p>

<p>Its taste for them has often been discussed,
but none of the theories propounded were more
than guesses. The most interesting incident
mentioned in these discussions concerned a
leopard in the Shan States of Burma. It
ordinarily lived on dogs and game and cattle,
like other leopards, but once it killed a man and
a woman. The magistrate who went to seek
the corpses told me that, in following the trail,
ornaments the woman had been wearing were
found in bits on the ground, and then the two
corpses—the man’s untasted, the woman’s more than
half-eaten.</p>


<h3 title="3. No Man Comes Amiss">3. NO MAN COMES AMISS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">This</span> leopard was, without an effort, catholic
in its tastes, especially when hungry. It
seldom ate mere venison, or touched the dogs
which common leopards love, but nothing human
ever came amiss. It never heeded caste. It ate
woodmen. It ate policemen. It ate the village
artisans, especially leather workers, caught outside
the villages. It ate a holy hermit, and was
fond of priests. It ate postmen. It ate pilgrims.
<a name="pg_125" id="pg_125" href="#pg_125"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>125<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The pilgrims crowded into bigger parties on its
account, and kindled fires at night, and took
turns of watching. More than once the leopard
came upon the pilgrim sentry, not very wide-awake,
and killed him suddenly. The rest were
safe for that night, but did not sleep much. A
solitary ploughman in a field, as he turned his
cattle at the corner, was seized from behind, and
had rest from his toil. It seldom happened that
even the bones were found. The leopard did
not eat the bones, but there were other beasts of
many kinds and sizes to finish what was left.</p>

<p>The total of its “kills” came in the end to
about three hundred, more or less, spread over a
“considerable time” as these things go, that is to
say, a year or two, more than a year, “a good deal
more than a year,” it was said. In the long-drawn
life of a man, who is very long lived for a beast,
it can very seldom have happened, if ever it did
happen, that any man, with all the helps of
mechanism, has killed so many leopards.</p>


<h3 title="4. Its Way of Doing">4. ITS WAY OF DOING</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">“How</span> could you be sure that this ‘kill’ was
done by this particular leopard, and not
by another?” was my frequent question,
<a name="pg_126" id="pg_126" href="#pg_126"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>126<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>variously answered, according to circumstances. It
had a style of its own, one seemed to feel, after
hearing a few of its exploits. There were
instances of men hunting it, who were killed instead
of killing; but, curiously enough, its most peculiar
feat was a failure, from the leopard’s point of view.</p>

<p>It went into a big village one day, between
four and five o’clock in the afternoon, and in
broad daylight strode through three-quarters of
it, passing between two rows of houses. Swiftly
as it seemed to sweep past, it must have been
going slower than usual, for it looked right and
left as it went, sending piercing looks into many
screaming interiors. Near the farther end it
turned and walked straight through the open
doorway into an old man’s house, without pausing,
as if it had come by appointment. The old man
was alone inside, and lay dozing. It took him
from his bed, and carried him away, and, strangest
of all, instead of going to the outside of the
village near that end, retraced its steps by the
way it had come.</p>

<p>Men’s shouts now mingled with piercing
screams and the old man’s cries for help, and the
leopard saw in front of him, blocking his path,
nine or ten men with big sticks. “By the grace
of God” they had found it in their hearts to face
<a name="pg_127" id="pg_127" href="#pg_127"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>127<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the monster, with no better weapons than these.
Give honour where honour is due! There was
courage needed for that.</p>

<p>With the dexterity of a Boer commander, who
had ambuscaded a detachment but found an
unexpected hostile force in his rear, the leopard
grasped the situation, and changed his plans.
Turning aside and passing between two houses, he
escaped unhurt, but dropped the old man, who was
also unhurt in body, though badly shaken in nerves.</p>

<p>The long evening hours did not drag so much
as usual that night in the village, but by three or
four o’clock in the morning there perhaps was
nobody living there who had not forgotten his
excitement and fallen asleep; and now the hour
was at hand when the cocks would waken the
world; but there was a ruder awakening than
usual that morning there. From the old man’s
house there rang out piercing yells. In a few
minutes every man within hearing had come to it,
with whatever weapons were at hand, and as many as
could enter crowded in to hear the old man’s story.</p>

<p>“I was sound asleep,” he said. “I seemed to
dream of a rat gnawing something beside me,
and, gradually, between asleep and awake, I began
to hear a kind of scrape-scrape-scraping. It was
so strange that I grew broad awake, trying to
<a name="pg_128" id="pg_128" href="#pg_128"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>128<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>make out what it was. Then I knew it was some
beast on the mud-roof above me. I lay and lay
and listened, and wondered what it could be. It
sounded like dogs at first, but I concluded it was
something else. No dog could scrape like that.
I thought of going outside and looking, but I felt
too tired to be bothered. I lay and lay and
looked at the inside of the roof, where the scraping
was. I did not expect to see anything. I
looked there, just because the scraping was there.
The place was there, right above my face as I lay
on my back. Just as I was taking a kind of last
look, before falling asleep altogether, I saw the
leopard’s two eyes shining at me through a big
hole in the roof. There’s the <span class="nw">hole!” ...</span></p>

<p>There was indeed a hole, and some of the
villagers said that in running up they saw the
form of the leopard disappearing in the moonlight,
and the roof outside showed marks.
“Nightmare,” I suggested, but Bingham would
not allow that. The marks showed that a leopard
had come; and I had to admit that, though there
was no direct proof that it was the identical
leopard, the odds were about a million to one
that it was, if, as the Privy Council Judges have
suggested, as a good rule in doubtful cases, we
pay regard to the likelihoods arising from known
<a name="pg_129" id="pg_129" href="#pg_129"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>129<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>habits and undisputed facts. (I have simplified
their verbiage, but that is their meaning.)</p>


<h3 title="5. The Final Fight">5. THE FINAL FIGHT</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> chief evidence that one leopard did all
the “kills” credited to this one was the
uninterrupted series while it lived, and the cessation,
for a while, when it died. But, though
practically uninterrupted in time, its killings
varied in place, to the perplexity of its pursuers.
More than once, when most of those who were
seeking it were in one locality, ambuscading half-eaten
remains, it went elsewhere, and started
afresh, where it had the advantage of being
unexpected. It took little pains to remain incognito.
It might have travelled far without eating,
as other tigers and leopards often do; but this
leopard was as self-indulgent as railway
passengers now can be, in comfortable expresses,
and beguiled the time by eating, as they do. It
seldom went a hundred miles without killing
somebody for a meal.</p>

<p>Colonel Bingham could not say whether it was
helped by the people being deprived of fire-arms;
but thought that probably nothing had happened
in the Central Provinces to make any difference
<a name="pg_130" id="pg_130" href="#pg_130"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>130<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to the leopard in that respect. A great many
guns were given out to likely persons to hunt it,
and many young officers, and some no longer
young, not military men only, but civilians of all
kinds, taking short leave on purpose, when they
could not otherwise come near it, gave their
leisure to the hunting of this multitudinous
murderer. “I never saw such cordial co-operation,”
said Bingham. “Rival hunting parties
forgot their rivalries, and helped each other to the
uttermost.” The beast was beginning to obsess
the minds of men; and, here and there, fields were
lying waste, uncultivated, through fear of it.</p>

<p>More than once a man with a gun was killed
by it, which does not, however, mean that a
leopard can openly “fight” a man with a gun.
It means that when a leopard can take a man by
surprise, a gun upon his shoulder is no protection.
They said so and explained it, to a postman who
had succeeded to a vacancy which the leopard
had made. Nevertheless the man continued to
flagitate his official superiors for a gun, until,
wearied by his importunity, they gave him one.
Then, as he went his rounds, that postman’s
inquiries after the leopard had a new significance.</p>

<p>The sight of his gun was pleasant to the
villagers, and they praised his public spirit. He
<a name="pg_131" id="pg_131" href="#pg_131"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>131<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>deserved their praise. Bethink you of the mails
he carried in the broiling sun, as he plodded many
weary miles along the dusty roads, and how long
you would have volunteered to add a gun and
ammunition to such a burden. What made his
conduct the more praiseworthy was that he knew
the gun would not save him if the leopard were on
the war-path and saw him first. In fighting of that
kind, as in guerilla war, it is often only the first
glimpse that counts. When the rule is to kill at
sight, then to see is to conquer.</p>

<p>He had been carrying the gun in this way some
weeks, at least, perhaps for months. It had
ceased to be needful for him to ask questions as
he went from village to village. At sight of him,
anyone who had news came to tell it. Many a
time he laid his burdens down, to let someone
far away but beckoning to him come to where
he was, and then they would sit and talk together
as if time had barely even a relative existence
and did not count for much. Nobody ever
grumbled. The rural mails were never in a hurry.</p>

<p>One ever-memorable day he was met outside a
village by many of the men who lived there,
coming out to meet him, and hastening to relieve
him of his business burdens with unusual solicitude,
leaving nothing to occupy him but the gun.
<a name="pg_132" id="pg_132" href="#pg_132"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>132<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Then with eager whispers they led him through
the village to a big tree on the farther side of it,
half bare of leaves. “See the leaves at that
corner, high up. He’s there, he’s there. We saw
him go there. Watch till the leaves shake. He
cannot move without shaking them.”</p>

<p>The postman got ready his gun, probably
putting the end of the barrel on a rest, though I am
not sure I was told that. It was unfortunate for
the leopard that there was no wind. The air
must have been rising, as I have seen it under
similar conditions, hot from the ground, as from
a furnace floor; but even through the shimmering
atmosphere the postman could see the leaves
were still, fixed, as if made of metal. The leopard
waited long, but so did he. And all was hushed.
Then he saw a slight, slight movement, just
visible among the leaves; and then he fired.</p>

<p>It was some time before the leopard came down,
and still longer before anyone ventured close enough
to the body to be sure it was dead. But whatever
reward had been offered was now payable to the
postman. The details of the post-mortem have been
sufficiently indicated already; and indeed they were
no part of the life of the leopard, which, almost
immediately after the postman touched the trigger,
ended suddenly. And so does this—its history.</p>

 />ON HEADS IN GENERAL</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> earliest human tools were weapons too,
mere sticks and stones; and perhaps the
earliest great discovery, before the invention of
fire and in days of infinite antiquity, was the
importance of heads.</p>

<p>The value of the discovery was due to the
natural weakness of our limbs and teeth and nails.
The other beasts were better provided with natural
weapons and neither needed tools nor made them.
The importance of heads did not concern them at
all. The lions and tigers, who are regularly killing
men and cattle in the way of business, do it
as we kill fowls, by a sudden jerk of the neck.
They have other ways, but they seem to like that
best, as Homer noticed, and we can see to-day.
<i>See</i> Pope’s translation, <cite>Iliad</cite>, v. 206, etc.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="hang">“... When the lordly lion seeks his food</div>
<div>Where grazing heifers range the lonely wood,</div>
<div>He leaps among them with a furious bound,</div>
<div>Bends their strong necks and tears them to the <span class="nw">ground....”</span></div>
</div><!-- stanza -->
</div><!-- poetry -->
</div><!-- poetry-container -->

<p>That is exactly the principle of the improved
<a name="pg_134" id="pg_134" href="#pg_134"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>134<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>drop of the modern hangman, and swift and painless
enough to please the most humane; but it
needs a greatly superior force. The hangman is
magnificent; but he is not war. Herein lay the
importance of the discovery that hitting the head
could stun and kill. Thereby the primitive sticks,
by which our long-forgotten ancestors straightened
their backs and stiffened their feeble knees, became
clubs; and men began to face the lions in their
path, and other enemies.</p>

<p>But for this great discovery we would have
remained as restricted in diet and outlook as the
chimpanzees. Whether tending cattle or cultivating
the ground, men must be ready and able to
take the open field and hold their own against all
comers.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we find that the discovery was
familiar in the remotest of recorded times. The
wearing of helmets is a fashion as ancient as
civilisation itself. The Rig-Veda Aryans had helmets,
and the Homeric Greeks, and in the ancient
classical <cite>Odes</cite> (iv, 2, 4, 5) a Chinese poet, perhaps
coeval with Homer, tells of a potentate:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="hang">“He’s thirty thousand men afoot,</div>
<div class="i1"><span class="ns">  </span>Who handsome helmets wear,</div>
<div>With shells and bright vermilion strings</div>
<div class="i1"><span class="ns">  </span>That flutter in the air,”</div>

<p><a name="pg_135" id="pg_135" href="#pg_135"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>135<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>thus anticipating the “red coats” of England.
Indeed, that is not the only coincidence of old and
new. The Homeric chiefs went among their men,
in times of confusion, striking right and left with
effective, home-made sceptres of wood, like modern
policemen with their truncheons. The helmets of
the police make the likeness almost palpable.</p>

<p>In the House of Commons a touching medieval
survival is the wearing of hats. It comes down
from the days when the steel-cap clapped on the
head was the first step in a breach of the peace,
and the head uncovered was the silent, unmistakable
symbol of the peace-making speech, the soft words
to turn away wrath. Little as he thinks of it, the
member, who takes off his hat and stands up to
speak, is led by a beautiful old custom to assume
an attitude such as Themistocles has been admired
for expressing, when violence was offered him in
council, and he said, “Strike, but hear me.”
Meanwhile, upon the table lies the unwieldy metal
bauble, meant to represent the mace or loaded
stick of the Speaker, who presides and makes no
speech, but silently tables his tool as if intimating,
“My voice keeps order and my club gives law.”</p>

<p>Every other mace as well as his, and every
sceptre and staff of office, is merely a sophisticated
emblem of the original reality, which is a common
<a name="pg_136" id="pg_136" href="#pg_136"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>136<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>stick. The weapons of ancient Egyptians and
Chaldeans are ancient indeed compared to
anything in Europe; but they are modern things, as
of yesterday, compared to the cudgel from the
woods. And what is perhaps the most remarkable
fact of all, while fashions change in war-tackle
as in ladies’ dresses, the primitive cudgel abides
the same; and under primitive conditions it is
wielded to-day by the hands of contemporary men,
exactly as it was wielded by our forefathers, who
preceded history so far that, in our books, we
speak of them as “missing.” We mean no harm,
and we shall, all of us, be missing some day. So
there has always appeared to me to be an
antiquarian interest in what is certainly, for other
reasons too, the best leopard story I know.</p>

<p>In 1886 a Burman farmer was working in his
fields, about twenty miles from Thayetmyo, in
Lower Burma, and noticed a leopard seize and
carry away a calf. He picked up a stick and ran
after it, shouting and waving the stick. The
leopard saw him and paused and looked at him;
but did not drop its prey, as the man had hoped.
He fingered the stick in his hands, not taking his
eyes off the enemy, and felt, to his joy, that it was
a “male bamboo,” a bamboo solid inside, a very
strong and formidable cudgel, light enough to
<a name="pg_137" id="pg_137" href="#pg_137"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>137<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>handle quickly and heavy enough to kill a man or
stun an ox.</p>

<p>They continued to eye each other askance, he
and the leopard. He would have been happy to
see it drop the veal and go. It would have been
well content to depart without hurting him. But
to go away supperless was not its intention, and
to let it take away his calf was not his.</p>

<p>It was interesting to study how they had
manoeuvred, the leopard trying to reach cover
without approaching the man, and the man to
prevent that, without risking an encounter face to
face. This lasted long. There was plenty of
active patience on both sides; and strategy so
admirable that I afterwards regretted that I did
not make a plan of the ground and record it all.
At length the leopard ventured a bound over a
bush and the man came within reach of it sideways,
and lifting high his “male bamboo,” he dealt
his first smashing blow on the skull. Everything
turned on that. To fail to stun the leopard would
have been most dangerous. But he did not fail.
He stunned it; and, with a shower of rapidly-repeated
blows, he killed it, and not only saved his
veal, but also earned the twenty rupees reward
that is always payable for killing a leopard.
Surely it never was better earned.</p>

<p><a name="pg_138" id="pg_138" href="#pg_138"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>138<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I happened to be in charge of the office of the
Deputy Commissioner at Thayetmyo, when he
came for his reward, and held the inquiry myself.
I noted the details carefully, because friends in the
station, one of them a veteran who had been a
quarter of a century in India, had nothing to tell
to equal it; and, in the twenty-three years that have
passed since then, during which I have heard on
the average more than one leopard anecdote a
month, I have never been able to verify anything
so good as this.</p>

<h2 title="XIX. The Unfinished Speech and Dance"><span class="chapnumber">XIX

 />THE UNFINISHED SPEECH AND DANCE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">In</span> fairness to the eloquent hero of this adventure
it should be told, lest any reader does not
know it, that wounded leopards are as dangerous
as wounded lions or tigers. There was one that
was clumsily handled by villagers in Burma a few
years ago, and six men died out of those it
injured; and I know a man who has told me, with
a shudder, that he has twice seen a clever hunter
at his side killed by a wounded leopard “charging
home.”</p>

<p>It was early in 1888, and on the plains near the
mouth of the Sittang river in Burma, that I was
one of about twenty men with rifles who gathered
round a big and leafy tree, in which a mortally-wounded
leopard had taken refuge. None could
see him; and, when his growl was hushed, we
could not even guess his whereabouts. It grew
tedious standing there, like waiting for a train that
is late. Many men fired at moving twigs, on the
chance that he might be below them. “He ought
<a name="pg_140" id="pg_140" href="#pg_140"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>140<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to be in bits by this time,” said one at last, “and
falling down in detachments.” But nothing fell,
not even a drop of blood. It became more and
more difficult to keep the villagers surging around
at a safe distance.</p>

<p>Then out stepped a brave sepoy, and, heedless
of the dissuasive shouts of his companions, he
prepared to climb the tree. I shouted “stop”;
and he grew eloquent, not in the style of Bengal,
but in the best Indian manner, heated sincerely by
seeing himself balked of a chance of distinction.</p>

<p>“What is the danger to <em>me</em>? Am I afraid of
anything? Let cannon and rifles thunder and
rattle, I will walk into myriads of them if I am
bidden. What is a leopard to the like of that?</p>

<p>“I want to <em>show</em> what I can do. I will show I
cannot be afraid. O, let me go! Do not bid me
stop! What is a little leopard? I could take a
tiger by the paw!</p>

<p>“It is a duty to slay that leopard, a duty to face
and kill him, a duty to the people, a duty to the
<span class="nw">Sarkar.” ...</span></p>

<p>Here note two things. First, see the innate
instinct of obedience, illustrated by the reference
to the Sarkar or Government. Fancy any
European talking of it in such a connection without
derision. Among our very soldiers it would
<a name="pg_141" id="pg_141" href="#pg_141"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>141<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>raise a laugh. Well indeed do the Indians say, as
they are now doing, that it is Europe that leads
and pin-pricks them into anarchy. The other
thing to note is the fine oratorical tact of the
speaker, worthy of Demosthenes. There was not
the faintest allusion to what we all knew, that the
leopard was sure to be dead presently. This did
not make it less dangerous to close with him, but
only made it quite needless. The speech ran on:</p>

<p>“It is a duty to slay that leopard. Through
this big village he went ravenous, seeking whom
to devour. He terrified the women and children,
and made the men shiver, while the sky rang with
shrieks. He stalked as a master through the
town” (here the orator, by a sweep of one arm,
included the adjoining village to the north); “and
the country shuddered with horror” (here, with
a sweep of both arms, he included the entire
countryside).</p>

<p>In fact, the leopard had been in search of a
superfluous village dog, and when he found
himself noticed and heard the people yelling, he
skulked from bush to bush till he was shot, and
then ran up a tree. The orator expressed the
matter differently. There is a great deal in the
way of putting things. What he next said was:</p>

<p>“He left the woods, the home of his kind. He
<a name="pg_142" id="pg_142" href="#pg_142"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>142<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>came among the dwellings of men. Shall we
make way for him? Shall he be suffered to ravage
and run away? Shall he come and go like our
master, as if we all were sheep and he the eater?
No! give me but the word, and up I go, and take
him by the paw, and fling him down. Danger?
What do I care for danger? O, let me at him, to
show how brave a man can be and make the
beasts beware! For, of all the duties a brave
man <span class="nw">has....</span></p>

<p>At this moment he looked up, as if at the sky,
but saw the leopard, suddenly visible, coming
down the tree, and hastily ran back, and was seen
and heard no more.</p>

<p>A curious sequel is worth telling. The wounded
beast ran into a bush; and a young Burman
policeman, who understood of the sepoy’s speech
only that he was boasting of bravery, resolved to
show himself the better man, and sprang forward,
dancing a beautiful <i xml:lang="fra" lang="fra">pas seul</i>, and brandishing a
big knife, the Burman sword, a handier weapon
than ours. “I’ll finish the leopard,” he cried, and
started for its hiding-place, running past me.</p>

<p>It was a pretty sight. We never see now in
Europe the solo dances still visible in Burma, and
some other eastern countries, on religious high
tides. We can only read of them in the Hebrew
<a name="pg_143" id="pg_143" href="#pg_143"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>143<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Bible, which tells of King David casting off the
trappings of royalty, and leaping and dancing
before the ark in a scanty garment, and so
scandalising the genteelest of his wives, Saul’s
daughter, Michal, who quarrelled with him about
it. A dance like David’s, if you are lucky, you
may yet see in Burma; but hardly again, in this
new world of breechloaders and explosive acids,
hardly but by some rare accident, can anyone
see what we saw then, a spontaneous Pyrrhic
dance done singly, so to speak, a man dancing
forward, flourishing his sword, to a deadly
encounter.</p>

<p>A most deadly encounter it might have been.
The leopard was shot through the lungs, and
bleeding to death, inwardly. I thought I had
noticed him spit blood, and anyone could see he
was badly wounded. But he was only dying, not
dead. His eyes flashed in the dark below the
brushwood, where he lay, and he raised his head
and half sat up, showing his teeth and growling, a
very loud, monotonous, continuous growl.</p>

<p>I just was in time to knock our hero down,
within five yards of the leopard, and step between
him and it, quickly joined by one or two others.
There was nothing to do but stand ready.
The uplifted head was lowered, slowly; the growl
<a name="pg_144" id="pg_144" href="#pg_144"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>144<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>grew less, and was punctuated by pauses, which
grew longer and longer. There was a long pause,
during which there was nothing to hear but men’s
breathing; then the dread silence was broken by
the voice of a young Burman, creeping past me on
all fours and crying, “Just let me pull its
<span class="nw">tail....”</span></p>

<p>It was an idle day that followed, which gave
them leisure to enjoy themselves. About twenty-nine
men spent it dividing the corpse.<!-- original has a comma --> They
quarrelled, and I quoted to them the proverb, “The
lot causeth contention to cease.” Sure enough, it
did so. They cast lots in peace, and told me that
eating such a beast made men partake the strength
and courage of the dead. I thought of many
things, as I listened, such as Marco Polo’s story of
tribes in Southern China, who were so sure of
acquiring fine qualities in this way that, if a
traveller seemed uncommonly beautiful or otherwise
gifted, they sometimes killed and ate him.
It is a strange belief, and, in one form or another,
it has appeared in many countries. But all the
same, whatever I happened to remember on this
occasion, the prevailing feeling was that the next
time there was such a job to be done, with such a
crowd, it would be alike expedient and gracious
to—delegate the leadership.</p>

 />THE BIG PET CAT</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">One</span> evening in the nineties I went to dine at
the house of a friend in Burma, and was
unexpectedly greeted at the entrance by a leopard
almost fully grown. He received me with the
same restful manner of dignified armed neutrality
that may be seen on the features of a domestic cat,
or of an old family servant, observing a strange
visitor.</p>

<p>“Do the others know?” I asked the host,
meaning the other dinner-guests, not yet
arrived.</p>

<p>“Yes, they all know him, but none of them like
him, or maybe it is that he does not like them, I
don’t exactly know what is the matter. He seems
to feel by instinct that you’re a friend. Dear old
fellow!” and the big cat laid its head confidentially
on his thigh, and rolled its eyes dubiously in the
way cats do, while a fat hand caressed its fine fur
tenderly, lovingly.</p>

<p>“It’ll be rare fun to see the rest arrive.” It was
<a name="pg_146" id="pg_146" href="#pg_146"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>146<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>indeed a pleasant entertainment to see that
bachelor’s house being entered as if a very
distinguished hostess were receiving the visitors.
The sight of “Mr Spots” made the most free-and-easy
a little constrained in manner. They kept
their eyes upon him; and as he moved about at
his ease, they made way for him with an agility of
quick politeness more common in Frenchmen than
in Englishmen. But though he engrossed their
conversation as much as their thoughts, there was
a lack of heartiness in their appreciation which
seemed to sadden their host. He tried to keep
the fine animal beside himself.</p>

<p>“Pets should always be young and growing
creatures,” he said, as he scratched its head, and
with many mingled puffs and sighs went on to
say, “They are a nuisance when they grow
up.... You lose their affection, you see....
Women are just the same.... This beautiful
beast does not heed me now, and at one time no
puppy could be fonder.... He would lie on his
back to be tickled by a straw, and play with me
by the hour.... He hardly ever snarled, even at
the servants. Look at him!” The gentle beast
was made to show his teeth and opened a
capacious mouth.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said one. “I’ve done nothing
<a name="pg_147" id="pg_147" href="#pg_147"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>147<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>but look at him since I came in, and have had
my hand on my pistol already, once.”</p>

<p>“He won’t hurt you. He’s <em>had</em> his dinner.”</p>

<p>Another visitor sent his dog home, and
opportunely remarked that as leopards were fond of
eating dogs, they felt at home with humanity as
lions or tigers never could. It was hunger only
that made these bigger beasts eat men. The
normal tiger or lion would run away from a
child, or at any rate pass it by. But even a
well-fed leopard might take to “long pig,”
meaning humanity, in simple wantonness, for a
change.</p>

<p>“I hope he always has plenty of salt with his
food,” said one. “Might I tell the boy to fetch
some for him now?”</p>

<p>“Why, in all the world?”</p>

<p>“Because it is the salt in human flesh that is
said to be the great attraction.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose my leopard spends his time
in studying chemistry, do you? I tell you he
would not eat you if you offered yourself. His
belly’s full.”</p>

<p>“Mr Spots” yawned and looked round the
company with an air of royal indifference. His
master continued to scratch his head. In obedience
to a gesture, he submitted quietly, when a servant
<a name="pg_148" id="pg_148" href="#pg_148"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>148<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fastened a chain on his neck, and reluctantly but
unresistingly he let himself be led away.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” said his master, looking after
him affectionately, almost as if apologising to the
pet. “That’s what is hurting his feelings,” he
explained to us.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The chain—the restriction—the want of
confidence is spoiling his fine temper.” After a pause
he added: “As I was saying, it’s the lapse of
time. Pets should always be adolescent, and
women too.”</p>

<p>“Not women,” protested one, who quoted “Age
cannot whither<!-- sic --> her nor custom stale her infinite
variety.”</p>

<p>“It’s not variety that <em>I</em> want,” cried he. “I hate
change. I would like my pets never to grow up.
It’s the change I object to. It’s horrid, these
<span class="nw">transfers....”</span></p>

<p>“Hillo! Are you transferred?” we cried, more
interested than surprised; for, as readers are
probably aware, the Europeans of every kind in
the east are at the best respectable vagabonds,
globe-trotters by trade, and only a few derelicts,
who are settling down to die, can have a fixed
abode.</p>

<p>“Transferred? No, no—I don’t mean that. I
<a name="pg_149" id="pg_149" href="#pg_149"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>149<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was thinking of transfers of affection,” he explained,
and he proceeded to discuss the claims of various
Zoos, and the chance of poor “Mr Spots” being
more happy in one than another, like a mother
discussing her daughter’s suitors.</p>

<p>Amidst the merriment that arose when all
constraint was ended, he was advised to wed, and
seemed to take the advice most seriously. He did
send away the leopard, and did take a wife, not
long afterwards; and as he was a good-hearted
man, I believe she is a happy woman; but she
little suspects who was her predecessor in her
husband’s affections.</p>

 />THE LEOPARD THAT NEEDED A DENTIST</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> excellent American dentist at Madras
had me “at discretion” in 1908; and as
he worked he began talking, in the kindly way
some dentists have, about things in general, and
in particular, when encouraged and led to that
topic, he spoke about the science of his useful
art.</p>

<p>“What spoils the teeth is want of use,” said he.
“Look at cats! What fine teeth tigers have!”</p>

<p>“When they are young,” said I, “are you aware
that tigers and leopards often die prematurely of
starvation, because their teeth fail them? There
is no kind of living creature that needs more than
they do the services of a really competent dentist.
See!”</p>

<p>He looked over his shoulder with a start, as if
half expecting to see some strange customer;
but it was only a common <span class="nw">messenger....</span></p>

<p>Resuming his work, he began recalling all he
<a name="pg_151" id="pg_151" href="#pg_151"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>151<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>had heard from various patients about cats’ teeth;
and suddenly ejaculated, “You’re right, you’re
right! I had forgotten what a man told me he
saw in the Nilgiris. From a distance, but close
enough to see well, he saw a big leopard seize
his dog as it played on the road. The dog got
loose, in a surprising way. The leopard caught
and mouthed him again, and then again; and
finally let him go and disappeared as men
approached. Three times that dog had been seen
in its mouth, and yet there was not a scratch on the
body of the dog. The leopard could not have
had a tooth in its head.”</p>

 />THE DEVIL AS A LEOPARD</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">In</span> 1891, in Shwegyin (pronounced Shwayjeen),
then the headquarters of a district in Burma,
but now decayed, because the railway went
another road, I became aware as I sat in office
of an unusual hush in the precincts of the public
buildings. My messenger came uncalled into my
room, and stood as if struggling to speak but
unable to articulate. My head clerk, the excellent
Babu Chowdry, followed him, though it was an
uncommon time for him to come in. With obvious
difficulty and hesitation, almost stammering, the
Babu said, “The devil has come to town.”</p>

<p>Ah, if I were only a fictioneer, what a brilliant
opening this gives for fine writing. It might be
indulged in without fear of contradiction; for, if
Babu Chowdry read a thing I wrote as an account
of our talk, he would not only affirm it to be true,
but honestly believe it. All the King’s Counsel
in London, cross-examining in partnership, could
not shake him, or do anything but make everybody,
<a name="pg_153" id="pg_153" href="#pg_153"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>153<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>themselves included, believe him the more.
His transparent good faith would convince them.
This is not ironical, but the simple truth. If I
wrote in the Kipling fashion, keeping faithful to
what the Babu could recall, he would trust me
for the rest, so that the story might be told in
this way.</p>

<p>“The Devil has come to town,” said the Babu.</p>

<p>“Show him in.”</p>

<p>“But he is not here. He’s in the town.”</p>

<p>“Send for him then.”</p>

<p>“But he won’t come. <span class="nw">He ...”</span></p>

<p>“Tell the police to fetch him.”</p>

<p>“How? <span class="nw">He ...”</span></p>

<p>“You should know perfectly that no warrant is
required. He can be arrested without a warrant
if he won’t come quietly, were it only for being
without a visible and respectable means of
subsistence. Send a note to the superintendent.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t a man. It’s a Devil, and a
leopard.”</p>

<p>“A leopard?”</p>

<p>“A leopard, but a Devil.”</p>

<p>“Shoot it.”</p>

<p>“But it’s a Devil.”</p>

<p>“Shoot it, all the same.”</p>

<p>“But it’s a Devil, and so the rifles won’t go off.”</p>

<p><a name="pg_154" id="pg_154" href="#pg_154"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>154<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Instead of all which, to tell the downright truth,
instead of any invention, I looked in silence
awhile at my excited clerk as he repeated, half
mechanically, “The Devil has come to town,”
and guessing that perhaps a tiger, which had been
flurrying the place for some weeks, had paid a
mid-day visit, I stepped outside to the verandah
to see what the matter was, probably telling
somebody to go for a rifle. I looked in all
directions, but saw no stampeding, such as might be
expected if a tiger were strolling anywhere near.
There were many marks of general consternation.
Everybody seemed to have stopped suddenly
whatever he had been doing. The one detail
capricious memory supplies is the sight of a man
at a refreshment-stall, who had paused with a
spoonful of food half-way to his lips, and stood
as if petrified as long as I saw him, gaping and
listening. Next I noticed the District Superintendent
of Police, Mr W. G. Snadden, a sensible,
first-rate man, coming from his office, which was
in a building adjacent to mine. Without waiting
to be asked, he shouted to me, “Don’t you bother.
It’s only a leopard frightening people at my house,
and I’ll go and see what the row is and come and
let you know.”</p>

<p>“Anybody hurt?”</p>

<p><a name="pg_155" id="pg_155" href="#pg_155"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>155<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“I believe not.”</p>

<p>I felt Babu Chowdry watching me to see if I
was satisfied. He drew a deep breath. “That’ll
be all right,” we said to each other, and both
returned to work. He came into my room a
minute later, and said impressively, “The people
do say it must be a Devil, as the rifles won’t go
off.” He waited to see the effect of the announcement,
but getting only, “That’ll be all right,” he
returned to business.</p>

<p>In an hour or so Snadden reappeared, looking
tired with laughing. This was what he had to
tell:</p>

<p>“My wife had a fright yesterday. A leopard
had been seen prowling round the house. A
servant said it came upon the verandah, and stood
on its hind legs and looked into the nursery,
where the baby was, and also a dog.” (Mr
Snadden intimated in some way that he had
doubted the story.) He continued: “I told
my wife it would prefer dog, but naturally she
did not wish it to have a choice. So I set
her mind at rest by leaving a military policeman
with a rifle to hold the fort when I
came to office, explaining to him what to do if
the leopard returned. It came all right, about the
same time as yesterday. They say the cook was
<a name="pg_156" id="pg_156" href="#pg_156"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>156<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in the act of showing the policeman where it
issued yesterday from the jungle, when they saw
it reappear.</p>

<p>“The man loaded, aimed, and pulled the trigger.
The cartridge did not go off. He slipped in
another noiselessly, and aimed again. There was
no hurry. The leopard did not see him. It was
standing still, apparently taking a deliberate
view of the house and servants’ quarters; looking
for a dog, I do believe. No man could want an
easier target. After aiming carefully he pulled
the trigger, and for the second time the shot did
not go off.</p>

<p>“This seems to have flustered him, so that he
made an audible click as he put in a third
cartridge, and the leopard heard it and looked round
and saw him, and turned to go away. He took
aim at it. It turned its head round for a parting
glance at him just as he pulled the trigger again.
For the third time the rifle failed to act. The
shot did not go off. The man was left standing,
half distracted. He said that as it disappeared
the leopard swelled to the size of a tiger, and the
glare of its eyes as it looked at him made his
heart stand still. It could be no common leopard
that bewitched his rifle so.</p>

<p>“Everybody in the house gathered round him
<a name="pg_157" id="pg_157" href="#pg_157"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>157<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to hear his story. That was when my wife sent
a man running to me. The policeman half-walked,
half-staggered to the lines” (the huts
where sepoys lived, near Mr Snadden’s house),
“and there he was when I went up. They had
had a glorious scare. By George, how quickly
the panic spread!” reflected Mr Snadden. “They
were shivering with funk all round the court
before the man, who was running from my house,
arrived there. I had noticed something was
amiss, and was making inquiries to find out what
it was before he came.”</p>

<p>“Had the man loitered on the way?”</p>

<p>“No, I think he came straight. The panic
round here was not his doing, whatever it was.
It came up from the bazaar. I’ve made sure of
that. It seems a miracle. I’ve been round
pacifying the town. The bazaar was upside down,
business was stopped, women were shrieking and
running after their children a mile away from my
house, within a few minutes after the leopard
disappeared into the bushes. I cannot understand
it.”</p>

<p>“Was the beast seen elsewhere?”</p>

<p>“No. The panic was all about what had
happened and the rifle not going off.”</p>

<p>Neither of us ever knew how the panic spread,
<a name="pg_158" id="pg_158" href="#pg_158"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>158<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>though Mr Snadden had a fine scientific curiosity
about it, which made him take much trouble
inquiring. He concluded his report on this
occasion, thus:</p>

<p>“It did not last long at the lines. The man
had hardly told his story more than five times
when the Subadar (the principal native officer)
pushed his way into the middle of the crowd to
hear him, and, listening to him, took the rifle out
of his hands to examine it. He lifted the hammer,
and pointing to the leather on the nipple, asked
him, ‘Did you remove <em>that?</em>’ The man looked
stupefied, shook his head, and relapsed into silence,
and the excitement ended. The men were very
good about it, laughing only a little and not
unkindly. They did not jeer at the poor fellow,
but rather pitied him, for the accidental oversight
that had made him look so foolish, and given
him such a fright,” and made him miss the
reward of twenty rupees, more than a month’s
pay, which he would have got for killing the
leopard.</p>

<p>When the truth was known it was easy to
pacify the town.</p>

 />THE GALLANT LEOPARD</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> lions and tigers and leopards cannot
bring libel suits or arrange duels. So men
can call them cowards with impunity, and often
do; but it is not fair, and surely all who have
been long enough in the woods to know better
should do justice to the beasts that are dumb.
Besides, there is a real joy in telling the downright
truth. It is apt to have the merit of novelty,
for one thing. That is why it seems right to
tell in 1909 an adventure that befell three gallant
officers in Upper Burma, a little more than a
dozen years ago.</p>

<p>Three real ornaments of the British army, and
one of them so highly placed that in confidential
moments after dinner he spoke to me not of his
debts, but of his savings and investments, were
riding abreast together through a forest. Three finer
specimens of “Britishers abroad” the army could
not have furnished. They combined all its best
qualities—the wild daring of the Irish scallawag,
<a name="pg_160" id="pg_160" href="#pg_160"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>160<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the steadiness of the Englishman, and the cunning
of the Jew. If they had all been of one kind,
whether scallawags, Englishmen, or Jews, they
might have come out of this adventure less perfectly.
Great is the advantage of a judicious mixture!</p>

<p>What happened was that a leopard was looking
for a meal as they came along. He was not hunting
men. He was crouching among the bushes
beside the road and watching, as a cat watches
sparrows, a crowd of monkeys gambolling among
the trees, and unconsciously coming near him.
He is at home in the trees, and very fond of
monkeys; but they are too nimble for him, if
they have a chance. So he was biding his time,
till one of them would be within reach of a sudden
spring; and none of them had noticed him, when
the three officers came riding past.</p>

<p>Now, whatever the attraction was, probably
curiosity, what is certain is that the advent of our
gallant three caused a sensation in the little world
aloft; and, as the miniature men and women of
the woods crowded to see the very latest samples
of British officers, they saw the leopard too! And
with wild hullabaloo they hurried far away.</p>

<p>The leopard was angry. Had he not cause?
Who were these men to come and spoil his sport?
They, on their noisy iron-shod horses, prancing
<a name="pg_161" id="pg_161" href="#pg_161"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>161<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>along, with their orderlies clattering behind them,
coming as if the world belonged to them? He
felt like another Jonah, who could answer the
Lord inquiring, “Doest thou well to be angry?”
with a heart-whole emphasis, saying, “I do well!”</p>

<p>So he came boldly upon the road on which
they were galloping and stood upon it, facing them.
He took no pains to hide himself. He was no
longer in the mood for crouching. He waited for
them; but he did not lie in wait. His lips were
ajar, and every muscle tight—a pretty picture!</p>

<p>“Good God! There’s a leopard!” cried the son
of Jacob. See how deeply rooted is piety in the
Semitic soul! Men have known that man for
nearly twenty years, and never heard him mention
God at any other time.</p>

<p>They all drew bridle and dismounted. Even
the scallawag consented to do that. The Englishman
called for his gun. An orderly handed it to him.</p>

<p>“By all that’s holy, you’re not going to provoke
him by peppering him with snipe-shot?”</p>

<p>The Englishman agreed not to fire, as they had
no ball-cartridges. But the leopard was not aware
of that. The road was along the side of a slope.
The ground went steeply up on one side of it;
steeply down on the other. So the leopard,
“lightly and without apparent effort,” like a cat
<a name="pg_162" id="pg_162" href="#pg_162"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>162<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>leaping upon a chair, sprang upwards, and sat behind
a bush, 15 or 20 feet above the level of the road.</p>

<p>“Slight as the cover for him was, it would have
been ample, if we had not seen him go behind it,”
said one of the men to me afterwards. “We
remarked how well he knew to hide himself. Till
he went behind that bush we would not have
believed it could have covered anything. Once
he was there, it was only because we had seen
him go that we knew he was there. But for that,
we would have seen nothing. The ground being
above us was a help to us, and, knowing where to
look, we could see the outline of the leopard plainly
through the leaves. He had not allowed for that.”</p>

<p>No; he had not reckoned on the watchfulness
of three men resolute that the <i xml:lang="fra" lang="fra">élite</i> of the British
army should not be made into cat’s-meat. They
held each other back, so to speak, without any
difficulty. They could see that where the enemy
sat was like a magnificent spring-board. If he
had selected the eldest of them, and leapt with
his usual accuracy, he and his chosen one would
have been a hundred yards down the glen together
in a few seconds; and the excitement in army
circles would have been very great. Half a dozen
men would have “got steps.”</p>

<p>But these three were too wary. They—felt
<a name="pg_163" id="pg_163" href="#pg_163"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>163<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>their value to the Commonwealth. They <em>would</em>
not pass in front of him. Nothing would induce
them. It was, “You first, sir,” for a long time,
till the leopard was tired of it, and saw the game
was up. He leapt down lightly and crossed the
road before their faces, with a deliberate swinging
stride, looking round at them as he passed.</p>

<p>“There really seemed to me to be something
of a swagger in his walk,” said one of the officers,
naturally imputing to the leopard the feelings of
a man and an officer; but in truth the leopard
had no swagger in his mind. He looked at them
in passing, as at creatures he had to keep an eye
upon; but, far from thinking of impressing them,
he was as indifferent to their feelings as the rocks.
In Hamlet’s phrase, they were less than Hecuba
to him. They were merely passing animals, that
had disturbed his hunting, and he was now quitting
them as he would a herd of deer that had got wind
of him and held aloof.</p>

<p>What seemed his swagger was the unconscious
dignity of his gait. I have seen it in a tiger,
crossing a road in the moonlight, when he thought
he was unobserved. Many men have remarked it.
It may be seen in the common cat occasionally,
and has been explained in various ways. The
swift movement by long strides and the silent
<a name="pg_164" id="pg_164" href="#pg_164"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>164<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>footfalls are easily noticed; but there is more than
that. The dignity of cats is one of Nature’s
effects, which we can see and admire, but not
reproduce. How could we, standing up on our
hind legs and to that manner born, ever do more
than mimic it? The most puissant of potentates
may call himself the son of the sun, the cousin of
the moon, and the father or grandfather of all the
stars; he may be named in sheepskins and figure
in sheeps’ heads as the King of kings and Lord of
lords, the Emperor of emperors and Czar of czars;
but he is first cousin to the monkey all the time.
His gold lace and purple cloaks, his tinsel hats
and thrones maybe as high as pyramids, cannot
make him cease to be funny when he swaggers;
and, at the best, you half expect a wink. Nothing
can give us the born dignity of the feline fellows.
But we need not envy them. Soon, very soon, in a
century or, at the latest, a millennium or two, there
will be none of them left, except perhaps the household
toms and tabbies. “So runs the world away.”</p>

<p>Thus it was without any thought about the officers,
who were standing abashed, that the leopard moved
down the steep slope into the depths of the glen,
abandoning all hope of well-fed British beef, and
perhaps deciding to try once more for the monkeys.</p>

 </span></span></a>It is only needful to add that this adventure
was told me by one of the three. I have not been
able to get leave to give the names; but that does
not matter, for the leopard did not know the names
himself. It was enough for him, and must be
enough for us, to know that they were strong and
healthy men, and their orderlies the same; and to
the leopard the iron-shod horses may have
appeared to be equally formidable. Yet, with just
cause of offence and an empty stomach to
stimulate him, he faced them all, and departed only
because he saw it was useless to wait for them to
pass. They <em>would</em> not go in front of him. Was
ever leopard so honoured before? These men
would not have deferred so much to a British
lord, much less to an Italian pope or common
emperor.</p>

<p>If leopards dealt in art, that would be a scene
for a picture; and fain would I have sent the
men’s photos to an R.A. of my acquaintance;
but to ask them for that purpose would have been
as hopeless as to ask leave to give their names.
So any inspired artist who pictures this scene
must paint the officers’ faces from his fancy. All
that I am permitted to certify is the truth of the
adventure.</p>

<p>Bravo, Mr Spots!!!</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> Griffin at Temple Bar, a lump of metal
like a medieval nightmare, is one of
multitudinous monstrosities such as Burns described:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="hang">“Forms like some Bedlam Statuary’s dream,</div>
<div>The crazed creation of misguided whim;</div>

<div>And still the second dread command be free;</div>
<div>Their likeness is not found on earth, in air or sea!”</div>
</div><!-- stanza -->
</div><!-- poetry -->
</div><!-- poetry-container -->

<p>The significance of the Griffin, however, goes
deeper than the conventionality, which alone the
artists deride; for it is only half an explanation to
cry “conventional.” What made it “conventional?”
Why did men convene to admire such an object?</p>

<p>One has to grope among the beginnings of
history to be able to guess; and for that purpose,
one has to stoop to the mental level of wild
backwoodsmen, not men of civilised breeds who have
reverted, like the mustangs of South America, but
real, wild backwoodsmen, none of whose ancestors
have ever been anything else, since time began.</p>

<p>On trying the thing, I found it as easy to think
<a name="pg_167" id="pg_167" href="#pg_167"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>167<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with them as ever it was to keep down to the level
of civilised men, carousing after dinner, when</p>

<div class="hang">“The soul subsides, and wickedly inclines</div>
<div>To seem but mortal, e’en in sound divines.”</div>
</div><!-- stanza -->

</div><!-- poetry-container -->

<p>Of course it is a commonplace to connect the
Griffin with the winged lion of Babylon and other
misshapen beasts. But Babylon was as much
sophisticated as London is to-day, and as far
removed from primitive conditions.</p>

<p>It is among the wild backwoodsmen, if anywhere,
that one can reach back to the real antiquity; and
if you listen to them at home, especially when they
have forgotten you or suppose you asleep, you
gradually realise what a great place is filled in
their minds by beasts of prey, and in particular by
the little-seen-but-much-felt feline foes. Many a man
and woman among the jungle folk has never beheld
them at all, but few have escaped their depredations.
They combine the terrors of force and cunning, and
abide a bugbear to humanity, from infancy to age.</p>

<p>Perhaps this may be best illustrated by one of
the most famous incidents in the life of Confucius,
dated by the <cite>Family Sayings</cite> at <span class="allsc">B.C.</span> 516, about
the time when Darius was sacking Babylon. Here
is the paragraph in the old Chinese history (translated
by Legge, <cite>Li Ki</cite>, II. II. 3, 10.)</p>

<p>“As he was passing by the side of the Ta’e
<a name="pg_168" id="pg_168" href="#pg_168"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>168<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>mountain, there was a woman weeping and wailing
by a grave. Confucius bent forward in his carriage,
and after listening to her for some time, sent Tsze-Loo
to ask the cause of her grief.</p>

<p>“‘You weep, as if you had experienced sorrow
upon sorrow,’ said Tsze-Loo.</p>

<p>“The woman replied, ‘It is so. My husband’s
father was killed here by a tiger, and my husband
also; and now my son has met the same fate.’</p>

<p>“Confucius asked her why she did not remove
from the place, and on her answering, ‘There is
here no oppressive government,’ he turned to his
disciples, and said, ‘My children, remember this,
oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger.’”</p>


<p class="tb"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>It takes an effort for a modern man to feel the
force of the words of the sage. The tiger means
so little to us, and meant so much to the weeping
woman and her neighbours. Still harder is it for
us to realise the primitive ignorance of the exact
shape of the enemy. Even to the few backwoodsmen
who have seen one dead, it soon becomes a
vague recollection. The infinite terror of the
beasts and the ignorance of their forms are not
the less indubitable facts, because they are so far
beyond our ordinary comprehension; and these
are the facts that perhaps explain, so far as we
<a name="pg_169" id="pg_169" href="#pg_169"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>169<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>can explain, the grotesque shape of the Griffin.
We must remember that our Zoos are a modern
invention, almost like firearms; for two or three
millenniums do not make antiquity in a world so
old as ours. In the days when Griffins first took
shape, whatever was the most hideous object would
seem to be the best likeness of the horrid reality.</p>

<p>But the Zoos should let us know better now;
and our writers and speakers should teach us
better than to hate the beasts of prey. It is quite
unnecessary. There is something coldly impartial
in their war with us. They do not hate us, any
more than the rocks do, or the icebergs. Red,
“red in tooth and in claw,” they remain
unconscious instruments of Fate, and serve to stiffen
us. If they kill us, it is in self-defence or for food.
There is no wanton cruelty; but there is no mercy.
There are surprises, but no treachery. Even the
French do not feel themselves betrayed, when it is the
wolves that win. There is no sentimental humbug
about this war; but also, no excuse for ferocity.</p>

<p>I never visit a Zoo and see the poor prisoners
behind the bars without hearing, with the mind’s
ears, a greeting, an appeal for pity, as if the poor
big cats were really saying what they can only
symbol in silence.</p>

<p>“Look at and pity us! You will not have such
<a name="pg_170" id="pg_170" href="#pg_170"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>170<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>cats to look at long. Lions and tigers, leopards
and jaguars, the species now all perishing salute
ye, O men!</p>

<p>“We are neither grotesque nor hideous, neither
wicked nor cowardly, neither cruel nor treacherous.
We are merely cats. We had to live in the only
way for which we were adapted.</p>

<p>“The war between you and us is nearly over
now. It has lasted long, but the end is at hand.
The world is lost to us big cats, and we are passing
away, on the wings of the <span class="nw">wind....</span></p>

<p>“Woe, woe to the <span class="nw">conquered!!!...</span></p>

<p>“Ye may lay aside your fears! Do lay aside
your fears, for fear is cruel. Ye have no need to
fear us any more. We are your prisoners of war,
and spared to make a human <span class="nw">holiday....</span></p>

<p>“We killed or left alone, and cannot guess why
ye do otherwise; but we cannot understand ye
at <span class="nw">all....</span></p>

<p>“We look around into daylight that is dimmer
than darkness, and see not why we are here. We
submit, because we must; and we are dying, dying,
dying! All your devices but prolong our deaths!
For life needs liberty. There is no life in prison
for cats, or for <span class="nw">men....</span></p>

<p>“The species all about to die salute ye!</p>

 />THE FOX IN THE SUEZ CANAL</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">One</span> afternoon, about the end of the nineteenth
century, a steamer was passing
southwards through the Suez Canal, and as I sat
in the shade on its deck and looked eastwards
over the desert, I saw a little animal with a bushy
tail running along the ridge at the canal side,
keeping level with the steamer. A slight
occasional glance in our direction showed that he
knew we were there. At first, he appeared to be
a jackal; but, when glasses were turned upon him,
we agreed that he was more like the fox indigenous
in the deserts and the lands adjacent, the
“fennec” as it is called, the “little fox” of Scripture
that is said to spoil the vines in one passage.
It is a true fox; but smaller in the body and
bigger in the eyes and in the ears than other
foxes, and more easily tamed. By destroying
vermin, he perhaps balances his account with
humanity, and is no more considered an enemy
than the swallow. He is said to eke out his want
<a name="pg_172" id="pg_172" href="#pg_172"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>172<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of strength by diligence, and often escape his
enemies by digging himself into safety. Needless
to say, unlike many other foxes, this one digs his
own hole, and is never without one, so that it
must have been of him that Jesus was thinking,
when He said: “The foxes have holes, and the
birds of the air have nests; but the Son of
Man hath not where to lay His head” (Matt.
viii. 20).</p>

<p>A lady, who was watching him with delight,
was afterwards sorry that she pointed him out to
various idle men. She intended only to give them
pleasure; and did not in time bethink her, in what
their pleasure lay. Complacent cries of sham
excitement were soon followed by—“ping”—a
shot from the bridge; and the bright little fox
ceased, suddenly, to run abreast of us, fell
suddenly lame, and crawled aside.</p>

<p>“Well shot!” cried several raucous <span class="nw">voices....</span></p>

<p>Some Arabs, working near, looked up to see
what was being fired at, and leaned on their tools,
and spoke to each other, looking, from time to
time, at the steamer and in the direction of the
fox. In 1886, living at Suez some days, I had
had various talks with such men, seeking to sound
their sentiments on things in general; and on this
occasion, I felt that I knew, as well as if I had
<a name="pg_173" id="pg_173" href="#pg_173"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>173<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>heard it, that they were saying to each other—“What
bloody brutes!”</p>

<p>What seemed to confirm this guess, was that
I did overhear our Indian deck-scrapers making
<span class="nw">remarks....</span></p>

<p>Three or four days later, a fellow-passenger was
still gloating over the glorious achievement. We
were near the south of the Red Sea by this time.
Thinking to make him sorry for the wounded
beast, I said—“The fox is likely to be dead of
starvation and thirst by now.”</p>

<p>“Ha, yes,” said he, “it isn’t likely to live much
longer after a Martini bullet has perforated its
thigh, ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“People don’t shoot foxes in England.”</p>

<p>“They kill them in another way. They’re just
as cruel.... Of course, one would rather have
galloped after him; but what can you do from a
ship’s deck?”</p>

<p>“Not gallop, certainly.” I tried another tack.
“It is thought wrong, in the Highlands, I have heard,
to shoot at the deer, unless you are likely to kill.”</p>

<p>“No?” He seemed surprised; but after a
pause, he could explain the mystery. “It would
spoil the venison,” said he.</p>

<p>“Do you think the man who shot the fox in the
thigh has nothing to be sorry for?”</p>

<p><a name="pg_174" id="pg_174" href="#pg_174"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>174<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“He could not be sure of the head. I think
that, on the whole, he did very well. He was in
a moving ship, and it was running.”</p>

<p>“Are you not sorry for the fox?”</p>

<p>“Not at all.”</p>

<p>I was tempted to say I was sorry for him; and
could have said so, sincerely. But, after all, he
was young, and a human being, though mentally
and morally less developed than the Indian seamen
or the Arab labourers. I was loath to hurt
his feelings. He deserved as much consideration
as—the fox. So we changed the subject.</p>

 />SOLIDARITY AMONG THE BRUTES</h2>


<h3 title="1. Elephants">1. ELEPHANTS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Our</span> Indian newspapers recently (1909)
reproduced reports of a public meeting in
London, which had been made remarkable by
the presence of the veteran Mr Selous, who had
assured inquirers that the elephants do really
assist each other in distress. He doubtless gave
details of many modern instances; but the
newspapers omitted them. So here is one.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1897, some herds of wild
elephants spread far and wide over the harvest
fields in Toungoo district, Burma. They had
used to do that, not every year, but at intervals,
for generations; but this visitation was unusually
severe. The area cultivated was greater than
ever before, and the villagers had been disarmed.
On former occasions the elephants had gone
away as soon as the men began to shoot, or even
<a name="pg_176" id="pg_176" href="#pg_176"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>176<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to make a noise like shots, by putting bamboos
into fires which they hastily kindled on the
edges of the fields; but, on this occasion, the
elephants merely paused a little to trumpet to
each other, “I’m not hurt,” “Nor I,” “Nor I.”
Then they resumed grazing at random, heeding
the noises of humanity, the shouting and the
rattling of tins and sticks and the bamboo-crackers,
no more than the cawing of the
crows.</p>

<p>The news seemed to spread in the elephant
world that men had ceased to shoot; for as the
herd that came first went farther from the hills,
seeking pastures new, the farmers who had
begun to breathe freely were horrified to see
new herds appear. On the morning that the
first news came to me, it was followed in a few
hours by reports of fresh havoc, like those that
rained upon Job. “We’ll need an extra officer to
measure up the damage for revenue exemptions
on that account,” was the prudent reminder of
a responsible subordinate, expert in reeling off
official rigmaroles; but I took an original plan,
of which nothing was said, or ever would
have been, if that newspaper report had not
recalled to mind an incident too good to leave in
oblivion. I took the first train to a station that
<a name="pg_177" id="pg_177" href="#pg_177"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>177<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>seemed to be the centre of the elephants’
operations; and in less than two hours a general
engagement was in progress. A long line of men,
including military and other policemen and carrying
all the firearms of any kind available,
advanced as fast as they could towards the
elephants, whose demeanour and behaviour could
not have been surpassed.</p>

<p>Whenever they discovered that the shots were
now followed by bullets, they all ceased grazing,
far and near, as far as the eye could reach over
a spacious, level plain. They gathered into
herds, and, as soon as possible, every herd, with
cows and calves on the safe side and fighting
males next the enemy to secure the rear, was
moving towards the western hills, far quicker
than a man could walk. Many of them were
wounded, but none were left behind. I had not
myself the luck to see, but heard from many
others who saw it at the time, a sight that well
might be immortalised. A big, wounded tusker
had raised the men’s hopes. They knew the
value of ivory, and hastened to isolate him; but
two other big elephants, of which one at least
was seen to be a female, ran to him and
supported him, one at each side. They held him
up as he limped along and joined the herd in
<a name="pg_178" id="pg_178" href="#pg_178"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>178<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>safety, and all went off together. The men were
left lamenting, and admiring too.</p>

<p>Upon the hills, among primeval woods, the
elephants that roam, intent on provender, oblivious
of war, resemble the Yankees among the great
powers of the world. Their superabundance of
material brings water to the teeth of potentates
of prey; but the herds of elephants are too terrible
to tackle. They graze in peace in the cool glens,
and have been known, in thirsty weather, to drink
alongside a tiger. Such a thing, at least, has been
reported as seen, and often inferred from tracks.
Think of what must have been in the heart of
the tiger, as he lapped the cool water, with an
empty stomach, and eyed the elephants’ calves.
But “whatsoe’er he thought, he acted right,” and
departed without hostilities, undoubtedly
protesting, in the language of the woods, his love of
peace—which was no doubt sincere, under the
circumstances.</p>


<h3 title="2. The Baboons and the Leopard">2. THE BABOONS AND THE LEOPARD</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">It</span> is not ill deeds alone that are done because
the means to do them are in sight. The
same is true of good deeds also. The elephants
<a name="pg_179" id="pg_179" href="#pg_179"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>179<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>can help each other better than most quadrupeds,
because they have trunks; and so can the
monkeys, because they have hands. Herein lay
the primitive germ of society. Indeed there is
profit in remembering this, for it follows that
selfish greed, which is the root of gambling and
theft of every kind, is a reversion in the scale of
being, not merely to the monkey level, but far
below it, to the level of the cats and fishes.</p>

<p>Be the explanation what it may, the mutual
helpfulness of monkeys is well ascertained. They
could hardly survive in the woods on other terms.
A male baboon in Egypt has been seen to turn
and face some dogs, and protect and deliver a
young baboon in danger of succumbing to them.
Here the remarkable thing is that it was the
male that did it. Many females would fight for
their young. Maternal love is the taproot of
life; but the root of society is family solidarity.
That the poor “dog-faced” baboon of
old Egypt, unaltered for 6000 years, is able to
rise so high in the social scale as this, is perhaps
what is best worth knowing about him.</p>

<p>The leopard is the great enemy of monkeys of
all kinds. This may be said to be true “all the
world over,” if the American jaguar is called a
kind of leopard, as it sometimes is. So it is with
<a name="pg_180" id="pg_180" href="#pg_180"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>180<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>special pleasure that one reads of an incident seen
in Africa not long ago by Sir J. Percy Fitzpatrick.
It occurs in the standard biography of his dog,
<cite>Jock of the Bushveld</cite>, pp. 270, 271, 272, and it
happened to a leopard that narrowly missed
dining upon the hero, “Jock,” and so cutting
short his distinguished career. Jock’s master,
apparently, was a-hunting, and saw the leopard
pinning a baboon with its left paw in the bottom
of a stony glen; but before it could do more, a
host of angry baboons descended the rocks
towards it, with an uproar that even to a Fitzpatrick
seemed deafening; and upon the leopard, which
had one paw occupied, they “showered loose
earth, stones, and debris of all sorts down with
awkward underhand scrapes of their forepaws”
(meaning their hands). Nearer and nearer they
came, while the leopard vainly threatened them
with its free forepaw. Louder and louder grew
the uproar. The baboons, like old Cato and the
Chinese, believed in shouting and grimacing to
frighten the foe; and here they practised that.
Neither Cato nor any Chinese warrior could
surpass a monkey in twisting the features. The artist
who tried to represent their contortions in Sir
Percy’s book has done his best, but could not
succeed. It is “like painting fire,” as Carlyle once said.</p>

<p><a name="pg_181" id="pg_181" href="#pg_181"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>181<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The leopard became alarmed. It is an Indian
proverb that the tigers do not count the sheep;
but the baboon is not so negligible. The corpses
of a chimpanzee and a lion, it has been reported
(but not by Sir Percy), have been found interlocked,
the chimpanzee having been disembowelled,
and the lion throttled. The leopard could not
know that. I confess I have doubts of the truth
of the history myself. But the leopard had
misgivings as the noisy crowd came nearer and
nearer, and let his victim go. Sir Percy watched
the triumphant baboons depart. “The crowd
scrambled up the slope again,” he reports, and
he tells us he believed, and so may we, what “all
the Kafirs maintained, that they could see the
mauled one dragged along by its arms by two
others, much as a child might be helped <span class="nw">uphill....”</span></p>

<p>It is a likely guess that the fighting baboons
were the adult males of the tribe. This is a guess
suggested by another interesting bit of history.</p>


<h3 title="3. The Indian Baboons and the Bear">3. THE INDIAN BABOONS AND THE BEAR</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Dr Murphy</span>, now civil surgeon at Maubin,
in the delta of Burma, where this is
written, is a unique phenomenon. That is a
<a name="pg_182" id="pg_182" href="#pg_182"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>182<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>clumsy phrase to apply to any fellow-creature,
but accurate. He is a perfectly popular European
official—popular in spite of being an official,
because he is a good doctor, spontaneously
sympathetic, kind and helpful, and does not bully or
grab.</p>

<p>Two little facts may be told on the authority of
the present Deputy Commissioner of Maubin
district and his predecessor, to give Dr Murphy the
pleasure of seeing himself as others see him, and
to give strangers a glimpse of him. In 1908,
when he was about to go away on sorely-needed
sick leave, the good people of Maubin town, who
did not realise how ill he was, got up a petition
to the effect that Dr Murphy’s leave should be
refused, as Maubin town could not possibly
dispense with him. When he was expected to
return in 1909, the Deputy Commissioner hastened
to Rangoon to solicit that Dr Murphy might be
posted again to Maubin. That was how he came
to be in Maubin this year (1909), when he told me
three pretty anecdotes, which, knowing him well, I
retell now with as much confidence as if I had
seen and heard with my own eyes and ears
everything he told me he saw and heard.</p>

<p>In 1883 he and his brother were schoolboys at
Mussoorie in the Himalayas; and were in the
<a name="pg_183" id="pg_183" href="#pg_183"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>183<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>habit of frequenting a glen where lived a tribe of
Indian baboons, “langurs” the people name them.
These are “black-faced, white-whiskered, long-tailed,
big, grey monkeys, not by any means as
tall as a man, but as thick in the arm.” They are
a different species from the African baboons, but
quite as clannish. They live on terms of
neutrality with mankind, as the various tribes of men
may be said to live with each other; that is to say,
open hostilities are strictly avoided on both sides,
and stealing is restricted to what can be done in
secret. In this instance, as the stealing is all on
one side, it might be said they levied tribute upon
men, but they do not attack people. School
children at Simla have told this writer that the
“wild” baboons often sit and watch them, they
and the children eyeing each other with equal
curiosity.</p>

<p>Of course, they are not Quakers, nor even
Hindus. If people flung stones at them, they
would fling stones in return. The little brown
fisher monkey of Burma, too, will do that. But “in
deference to Hindu prejudices,” the English leave
them alone, so that they have probably never
noticed the English. They pay no taxes, these
white-whiskered gentlemen; and reciprocate human
forbearance. “Live and let live,” is their rule with
<a name="pg_184" id="pg_184" href="#pg_184"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>184<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>men, and so, in general, schoolboys hardly notice
them.</p>

<p>Great therefore was the surprise of the two little
Irishmen one day to notice the baboons in a state
of excitement, jabbering loudly, and plainly
preparing for battle. Their women and children
were all huddled in one place, and the big males
gathered in another, moving in a body. The boys,
as if by instinct, followed the crowd of males “to
see the fun,” whatever it might be, just as in the
Highlands of Scotland, when they were inhabited,
the boys used to follow the men at funerals and
weddings “to see the fights.”</p>

<p>Their curiosity was richly rewarded. The
baboons began to bait a solitary, angry bear.
The boys were dangerously close to the bear
before they saw him; but he did not heed them,
which was lucky. A bear, encountered at random,
is often “worse than a tiger,” it is said;
because the tiger can always get out of the
way when he wants, but the bear is so slow that
he despairs of escaping, and turns and rends the
man who has met him. In this case, luckily for
the two little Murphys, the bear was preoccupied.
The baboons swarmed noisily in the trees around
and above him. The elder of the two boys, who
alone saw much, said that he saw them incessantly,
<a name="pg_185" id="pg_185" href="#pg_185"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>185<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>one hard upon another, come close enough to slap
the bear violently with the open palm of the hand
on back or belly, on head or side, on whatever
point seemed safest of access—Smack! Smack!
Smack! Smack! Smack! Their objurgations
were like the sound of a cataract. The bear was
distracted, snapping and striking here and there,
but always missing. The baboons relied on their
agility to escape his teeth and paws, with
complete success, so far as the boys saw; but the boys
did not linger. They had not the feeling of
security that the baboons had; and, thankful to
have escaped notice, “Run, run,” cried the elder,
and they ran to a safe distance. There they stood
and listened; and when the thunder of the battle
and the shouting indicated the bear’s retreat, the
boys consulted the hillmen, and were told that
these battles, which were familiar to the hillmen,
always ended in that way.</p>

<p>The glen of the baboons was open to the south
and east, sheltered and sunny, and convenient for
the fields and gardens, in which the baboons could
seek for change of diet. The adjoining glen of the
bears had a wetter aspect. True, with all its
wetness, it had many oaks whose acorns were dear
to the hearts of the bears, and they meant to keep
it; but why not have the other glen also? They
<a name="pg_186" id="pg_186" href="#pg_186"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>186<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>esteemed the baboons no more than the Belgians
esteem the negroes. So, from time to time, an
Imperialist bear invaded the land of the baboons;
but the hillmen said that they did not think the
same bear ever came twice. The reason was that
the bear, invading, always came alone. He was
too inveterate an individualist to form a Chartered
Company. He did not even hunt in couples. So
the invader, irresistible as he seemed, was always
repulsed by the solid regiment of baboons.</p>

<p>Thus it is that men and baboons are taught the
need of solidarity. As Benjamin Franklin quietly
and sublimely remarked on 4th July 1776—“We
must all hang together, else we shall all hang
separately.”</p>


<h3 title="4. Simla Monkeys">4. SIMLA MONKEYS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> years go by like clouds. In 1902, Dr Murphy
was no longer a schoolboy, running
about Mussoorie, but a surgeon employed by
Simla municipality, and familiar with the little
monkeys there, who lived on Jacko Hill. They
overran the town, these little men; and took every
possible advantage of the toleration of the good
Hindus. Perhaps it is needful to mention that
Indians are so indulgent that European naturalists
<a name="pg_187" id="pg_187" href="#pg_187"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>187<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in India are continually surprised at the
slight fear of men among wild birds and beasts.
Thus it was that “Hindu prejudice” protected the
monkeys at Simla, though nobody suffered more
from them than the Hindus; but even they agreed
with Dr Murphy that “something must be done,”
when the little men from Jacko insisted on
entering his house and removing the bread from
the breakfast table.</p>

<p>It would be a long story to tell the plans that
failed. The plan that worked was beautiful in its
simplicity.</p>

<p>Two earthen pots were buried before the eyes of
the monkeys, looking on. Only the thick and
narrow rims were left above ground. What this
was for, no monkey could comprehend, and the
more of them that gathered, the more they seemed
perplexed. A “multitude of counsellors” may
bring confusion instead of wisdom. It was the
easiest thing in the world for any of them to put
in his hand and feel the emptiness of the pots.
But, why were they buried there? “Hum—hum,”
none of them could tell.</p>

<p>When they were about to disperse and dismiss
the matter, as one of the many mysterious
eccentricities of men, Dr Murphy put grain into
the pots in front of them. This was a sudden
<a name="pg_188" id="pg_188" href="#pg_188"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>188<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>illumination to the assembly. To keep grain safe
from monkeys is one of the continual problems of
Simla life. “And this is <em>his</em> way of doing it,”
thought the monkeys to themselves.</p>

<p>They did not delay to show him what they
thought of his device and him. It was really too
ridiculous. One of their leading men came
straight to the pots and put a hand into one of
them, keeping his eyes on Dr Murphy. It was as
easy as ever to put a hand in; but, when his
clenched fist was full of grain, he could not take
it out.</p>

<p>After one or two ineffectual attempts to withdraw
his hand, he put the other hand into the
other pot, which had been placed convenient for
that very purpose. Perhaps, when he put in the
second hand, his object was to find out what was
holding the first; but when it also touched the
grain, the force of habit made him grab with it
also, a beautifully human trait of character; and
there he stood with both his hands in chancery,
meaning by chancery a place that does not readily
let anything out that once comes in.</p>

<p>There he remained standing. It never came
into his head to open his hands and withdraw
them empty. He was an emblem of many an
Anglo-Indian, who has “heard the East a-calling,”
<a name="pg_189" id="pg_189" href="#pg_189"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>189<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and seeking a “soft job,” has wandered where his
tribe cannot thrive, but is detained by what he has
in hand, and cannot find the heart to forego. The
monkey stood there, with both hands full, quite
wealthy for a monkey, but a helpless prisoner. If
there had been pots enough, his kinsmen would all
have come and done likewise; but there were only
two, and he had monopolised them; and now he
had to endure the multitudinous advice of the
empty-handed monkeys, and their criticism,
<span class="nw">and ...</span></p>

<p>That was not all he had to endure. Dr Murphy
took a whip and proceeded to chastise him, not
very severely, but sufficiently to keep him from
thinking clearly in the abstract. Then the hubbub
thickened round the doctor. The tribe that dwelt
on Jacko gathered clamorous. Quick, from the
hill and almost every tree, wherever tribesmen
were who heard the news, they hastened to the
great indignation meeting, all seeming to talk at
once, and making hideous grimaces, at which, to
their surprise, Dr Murphy laughed aloud. They
did not understand his noises and grimaces; but
what they could not fail to see was his indifference.
Whack, whack, whack! He continued the flogging
amidst a chorus of disapproval, quite equal to that
of the United Press Association.</p>

<p><a name="pg_190" id="pg_190" href="#pg_190"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>190<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The prisoner broke away. The pots had not
been very strong; and in his struggles he had
broken off the rims. With an earthenware bracelet
on each wrist and both hands full of grain, he
reached the nearest tree; and there he opened his
hands and dropped the grain. “All that a man
hath he will give for his life.” But in this instance,
the general opinion of observers was that the grain
was dropped by inadvertence, as the monkey
opened his hands in haste to climb, forgetting
what he held.</p>

<p>By a similarly inadvertent knock against the
tree, he broke one of his bracelets as he went up.
Well for him if he had broken both! He joined
the crowd that had come to help him, with still a
bracelet (of a pot’s rim) on one of his wrists. This
caused an immediate revulsion of feelings. His
friends became his persecutors. They crowded
round him, pushing and pulling him, smacking and
scratching him, and biting him till the blood came.
In a few minutes that leading monkey would have
been dead, and perhaps they would have been
carrying his corpse to the hill, as some people said
they used to do, but suddenly, as the persecuted
one was floundering about, the fatal pot’s rim
broke and fell in pieces to the ground. Behold, he
was now as the other monkeys were, different from
<a name="pg_191" id="pg_191" href="#pg_191"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>191<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the rest no more, but sore afflicted and in agony.
They succoured him now, like a prodigal returned,
and helped him gently away, leaving the kind
doctor sad to see how far beyond his intentions
the poor fellow had been punished. The doctor
declared he would never set that trap again.</p>

<p>But how very human it was! To translate the
fine verse of Béranger’s song <span class="nw">(“<span xml:lang="fra" lang="fra">Les Fous</span>”)—</span></p>

<h3 title="5. Co-operation">5. CO-OPERATION</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Whether</span> or not the guess is right that in
that hubbub among the monkeys in the
Simla trees there was a rudimentary heresy hunt,
or, in other words, that the monkeys were screeching
whatever in monkey language intimated, “Bad
form, bad form,” “Order, order,” it cannot be
surprising to find solidarity such as theirs facilitated,
or even made possible, by what can only be called
<a name="pg_192" id="pg_192" href="#pg_192"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>192<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a kind of language. If Max Müller had been
beside Dr Murphy one day in 1905 in Simla, and
seen what Dr Murphy then saw, he would probably
have abandoned the proud claim he has made for
humanity to a monopoly of speech. We must be
content with the more modest boast of developing
it.</p>

<p>The doctor noticed a monkey sitting on the flat
roof of a small house in Simla, where lived a man
who roasted gram and sold it. The little brown
fellow was visibly hankering after the gram
exposed for sale on a tray before the door. He
leaned over and looked long at the man beside it.
Then the doctor saw him go to a short distance
and confer with four or five others, two of whom
returned with him, and three little heads bent over
the roof to study the situation and the unconscious
seller of gram.</p>

<p>Then one of them went down the water-pipe
behind the house, walked boldly round to the
front of it, and openly, before the eyes of the
astonished man, took a handful and ran away.
The man snatched a stick and chased him; and
Dr Murphy noticed with surprise that, of two
possible roads, the fugitive took the least
convenient for himself, but the one that best kept the
man out of sight and reach of his stall. As soon
<a name="pg_193" id="pg_193" href="#pg_193"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>193<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as he was gone, the two remaining monkeys
hurried down and helped themselves to handfuls
and escaped away, to be presently rejoined by
their daring colleague, who had drawn away the
man.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to exaggerate the
significance of this incident. These monkeys must
somehow have been able to speak together and
trust each other. To every union of several we
may apply what Heraclitus said of every unit,—“Its
character is its fate.” Solidarity is possible
in exact proportion to the degree of honesty
prevailing. So the monkeys must have had a
rudimentary kind of honesty as well as a rudimentary
kind of speech; and that was why they could act
on Moltke’s maxim—“<span lang="deu" xml:lang="deu">Erst wägen, dann wagen</span>”
(“First ponder, then dare,” or, in commoner words,
“Think before you act”), and then carry out
their plans and co-operate well. We would be
absent-minded beggars indeed if we did not see
here the germ of that tribal solidarity from which
all human civilisation has gradually evolved. Let
us never forget our humble beginnings, or despise
our poor relations.</p>

 />A RUN FOR LIFE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">In</span> Phayre’s <cite>History of Burma</cite> it is mentioned
that “the loud, deep-toned cries of the hoolook
ape ... resound dismally in those dark forest
solitudes, and startle the traveller ...” (ch. xxii).
They would startle only those who did not recognise
in the resounding “Oo-oo-oos” the voices of
harmless, primitive communities of hairy little
black men and women, called gibbons, the smallest
of the apes that closely resemble humanity. They
are probably the strongest of us all in the arms,
in proportion to their size; for it is on their agility
in the trees that they depend to escape their
enemies.</p>

<p>It was in an Upper Burman forest that one of
them was noticed a few years ago, pursued by a
leopard, which had got between him and the rest
of the tribe. What handicapped the little black
man—or was it a woman?—was the bareness of
the trees. If the trees had been more thickly clad
the spotted enemy could not have kept him in
<a name="pg_195" id="pg_195" href="#pg_195"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>195<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sight; but, as it was, whenever the gibbon looked
down, the leopard’s eyes were on him; and if he
paused to rest, it seemed about to mount. “Oo-oo-oo!”
On, on, on he had to go, there was no
rest for the gibbon. It was like Dante’s Hell. He
cried pitifully, incessantly, “Oo-oo-oo,” and his
kinsfolk answered him across the glen; but, what
could they do? They could no more mob a leopard
than the swallows could. “Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo!”</p>

<p>If he could have rejoined them, however, he
would have been safe; for then the leopard could
not have tired him out. So said the countrymen,
who explained the ways of “Mr Spots”; but in
this instance the leopard was able to keep between
him and the rest. The intervening space was
increasing. Did the little man know some round-about
way? “Oo-oo-oo!” The others answered
him, as if to say, “Cheer up! Here we are, waiting
for you!” “Oo-oo-oo!” His speed increased, as he
went farther away, as if he were growing nervous;
and surely he had lost his head for a moment
when he put foot on the ground, passing a gap,
thinking the enemy far enough behind. The
leopard was ready for that, and seized him.
Then, in that far corner of the glen, there was
silence—the silence of death.</p>

 />MOTHER’S LOVE AMONG THE MONKEYS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">In</span> January 1909 a friend at Pyapon, Burma,
told me that, as he was passing through an
unfrequented creek near the shore there, between
Rangoon and Bassein, the sudden apparition of his
steam-launch alarmed a crowd of monkeys. They
were on the trees, overhanging the water, and
chattering loudly. They hurried away, with leaps
and swings, quickly and easily, all but one. He
was a <em>very</em> little fellow, and there was a big gap
in front of him, too big for him; and so he stood
shivering, about to fall. His mother saw his
plight, and came back and joined him. To take
him was impossible. So she sat beside him; and
he pressed close to her and clung to her; and
she put one arm around him, and, quietly but with
quivering lips, she faced the awful apparition,
whistling, splashing, puffing. It passed without
hurting her or her son. They suffered nothing but
the fright.</p>

<p><a name="pg_197" id="pg_197" href="#pg_197"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>197<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“Very queer they looked as we came close to
them,” thought the men on the boat; but their
fear was as natural as that of men who see a lion
at large. It is likely, too, that that brown mother-monkey
had had losses before; and a mother’s
heart to feel them. Perhaps a memory of old
sorrows, dimly present yet, as well as something
of the sublime instinct which makes humanity at
times self-sacrificing and brave, had strengthened
her heart enough to let her face the immeasurable
dangers of the noisy, unknown monster.</p>

<p>Instead of laughing at her ignorance, think of
our own—how little we can ever know of her or
her tribe, how utterly undecipherable, mysterious
beyond any hieroglyphics, remain the lines upon
her face the “multitudinous wrinkled tragedies”
upon the parchment of that little brow! We pass
each other close enough; but an infinite gulf
divides us, a gulf deeper than that in the parable:
for there is no speech across it, no signalling, no
telegraphy of any kind. No communication whatever
is possible between us, any more than if we
lived in different solar systems. Only, we can see
and admire in her a mother’s love, exactly as we
can behold the flashing glories of the kingfisher’s
feathers, or hear the merry music of the lark. The
world is not a nightmare after all.</p>

 />EXIT THE HUNTER</h2>


<h3 title="1. Up to Date">1. UP TO DATE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Why</span> are there so few heroic tales of our
brave boys a-hunting with breechloaders,
may be asked. The truth is that, with modern
weapons, hunting is as unromantic as work in a
slaughter-house.</p>

<p>Men may still be wounded by teeth or claws, as
I have known one who lost an arm to a tiger, and
every now and then a man is killed, although he
has modern weapons in his hand; but it is mostly
by accident or stupidity, and nearly always by
preventable accident, like getting wounded on a
railway. It is painful, and may be fatal; but so
rare and so preventable that to take the risk needs
no more courage than to step into a train.</p>

<p>That is why so many lies are told. The truth
is bald. I have witnessed some, and credibly
heard of hundreds of hunting adventures, in the
most dangerous corners of the world; and read of
<a name="pg_199" id="pg_199" href="#pg_199"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>199<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>thousands more. To see the truth, one has to
allow for the many events that seem too
commonplace to remember, as well as for all the tricks of
slippery memory. Statistics are not available,
which is helpful in a thing like this; for statistics
are misleading, and can be quoted to prove
anything. So every man has to generalise from what
he knows; and, doing so, I concur in the opinion
of those judicious persons who think that the most
dangerous kinds of modern hunting are safer in
every way than common coal-mining. The
percentage of mortality is almost certainly a great
deal smaller. Not once, so far as I have been able
to believe, not once did any man, with modern
weapons in his hands, do anything very heroic, or
<em>need</em> to do it. The grit was often there; but there
was no real opportunity, for it is not the mere
taking of risks that makes the hero. The gambling
spirit is equal to that. The hero rises above
selfishness as far as above fear, and does what he
sees to be right, unheeding consequences. In our
long war with the beasts, which has lasted so many
millenniums, we needed such men at the start, but
not now. The brunt of the battle is over, and
anyone can finish it.</p>

<p>That is why there is little to tell in our anecdotes
of modern adventures, unless when something
<a name="pg_200" id="pg_200" href="#pg_200"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>200<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>happens under primitive conditions. Never did
any modern hunter have to face such danger as
was faced by a bereaved old Burman grandfather
in a village near Rangoon when he took a spear in
his hand, and, with other old men, ran after
the tiger that was carrying away his grandchild,
and closed with it. These old fellows showed a
spirit that makes one think better of humanity.
But what are we to think of the idle men with
breechloaders and servants? What drives them
to the field or forest? The heavy burden of life-weariness,
the Nemesis of idleness and plethora.
The best of them are seeking a relief from real
worries, perhaps, and the others killing time, or
seeking amusement. Why not? It is nonsense
for any man to dictate the pleasures of another;
but let us have no cant at any rate, no make-believe
heroics, as if the killing of cats needed
particular bravery on the part of a man with a
battery.</p>

<p>There are few more genuine pleasures in life
than that of a European officer, who is at hand to
help villagers in India against leopards or tigers,
and feels his gun of use; and the wounds, if any,
received in that way would leave honourable
scars. But such a coincidence of duty and pleasure
is rare, and seldom to be got by seeking for it. It
<a name="pg_201" id="pg_201" href="#pg_201"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>201<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>is altogether a different thing from the experience
of sportsmen in search of sensations.</p>


<h3 title="2. The Lion in Death">2. THE LION IN DEATH</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Here</span> is a cutting from a friendly review of
a recent book in the <cite>Westminster Gazette</cite>
of 5th December 1908.</p>

<p>“Our author, we have said, got no lions. Other
game came to him in plenty, but the lions always
evaded his gun. Yet he gives us a living picture
of a lion hunt, when the harried animal, which has
been trying to slink off, at last turns to bay and
determines on the fight to a finish:</p>

<p>“‘Death is the only possible conclusion.</p>

<p>“‘Broken limbs, broken jaws, a body raked from
end to end, lungs pierced through and through,
entrails torn and protruding—none of these count.
It must be death—instant and utter for the lion,
or down goes the man, mauled by septic claws
and fetid teeth, crushed and crunched, and poisoned
afterwards to make doubly sure. Such are the
habits of this cowardly and wicked animal.’”</p>

<p>Since Goldsmith described how</p>

 class="ns">[</span>202<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>there has been nothing to equal the humour of
this imputed wickedness. A simple person might
suppose that the lion paused to spit in poison, or
at least deliberately poisoned his teeth and claws;
whereas, of course, he merely does not clean them
properly. Having to live in the backwoods of
Africa, and support himself somehow, he cannot
command the toilet requisites of Belgravia. Is
not that wicked? And his cowardice, in not
standing to be shot at, is uncommonly like that of
the Boers. Why should he not avoid the enemy’s
fire?</p>

<p>In truth, it is plain that the author, as indeed
he tells us, was not describing what he saw, but
repeating what he was told. His words are not a
“living picture,” but, if he will allow me to say it,
a bloody blur, which no more gives an idea of the
real fight than the hospital beds give an idea of a
battle. In the supreme hour of conflict, both sides
“see red,” but not in that way. Neither thinks of
wounds. There seems to be no time for that.
The only thought is how to kill; and in the glad
excitement the manifold details of life and all its
conventions, which seem so real in cold blood,
are crumpled up like stage properties in a
conflagration; and all seems fair in war, and all <em>is</em>
fair; and the issue lies with the God of battles,
<a name="pg_203" id="pg_203" href="#pg_203"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>203<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and not with the elderly lawyers at The Hague or
anywhere else.</p>

<p>So much the worse is it then for the lions, and
so much the worse for any man or nation found
unready, unprepared. Ah, if we could only
regulate battles like law-courts, how different the
world would be! But God knows best. It somehow
<em>must</em> be better as it is.</p>

<p>If this Englishman or any other man would
meet the lion on equal terms, as knight met knight
in the Middle Ages, I am sure there is not a lion,
young or old, in Africa, there is not a tiger in
India or Burma, that would not accept the
challenge with pleasure. As the challenged party
would have the choice of weapons, and a sportsman
could not object to fair-play, we may be sure
that “Nature’s weapons” would be the lion’s choice,
and the victory swift and certain for the lion, even
if it rained Englishmen, to say nothing of other
people.</p>

<p>This is an old, old story. Hercules himself had
to use a club and poisoned arrows. It is by tools
and co-operation that we master the other beasts.
The cats are a particularly easy conquest, as they
are bigoted individualists. But let us not add
insult to injury, and call them cowardly because
they dodge us. When next our author is at
<a name="pg_204" id="pg_204" href="#pg_204"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>Lucerne, let him step aside into the garden there
and look at Thorwaldsen’s lion, cut in the living
rock, and see whether it does not lift his thoughts
above the shambles. The wounded lion he
described, according to the reviewer, was “trying to
slink off.” Thorwaldsen shows what it was seeking
to die in peace. Why chase and torture him
more? To get his hide? The lion-hunter, whoever
he was, although he risked his life gratuitously,
was like a silly child pulling a cat’s tail and a
thoughtlessly cruel child, for this big cat was in
mortal agony.</p>

<p>Machinery-murder, for beasts of every kind,
including men, is now a fact inevitable, and, like
everything inevitable, it bears a blessing in it, if
only we submit to the will of the Almighty, and
recognise what He has brought to pass. The
blessing latent in this apparent affliction, perhaps,
is that we may cease to admire the business of
slaughter; and if so, what a stream of blessings
may flow from that one.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">I have</span> just been invited to invest in an electric
apparatus, to be installed upon the tree one
sits in, when waiting over a “kill” for the return
of the tiger. The difficulty at present is to see to
shoot in the dark; and this invention enables you
to press a button and flood the place with electric
light. If then you are moderately quick, you can
shoot the beast while he is blinking at the light,
as easily as if it were day. You are as safe in the
tree as in a bedroom and very nearly as comfortable
on your platform. You can sleep there all night—four
nights out of five at the least—when nothing
happens. When the great night comes, that is to
say, when the tiger comes, even then you need not
lose more sleep than most passengers do in a
sleeping carriage on a railway. The swing of the
tree in the breeze and the rustling of the leaves
make your platform a superlatively soothing bed;
and as you lie back and look up at the drifting
clouds, and the moon or the stars, you can feel
you have the excitements of savage life, combined
with all the comforts of Charing Cross; for at
your side is a good fellow, willing, for a consideration,
to keep watch for the tiger, better than you
<a name="pg_206" id="pg_206" href="#pg_206"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>possibly could, and to watch you, too, and take
care that, in waiting, you do not roll over on your
back and snore, and finally wake you when it comes.
What a dramatic whisper it is in your ear—“Tiger
come! Tiger come!” Nothing in any theatre
can equal it! Do not be in too big a hurry to fire.
There is no need to hurry, if you take care to make
no noise at all, and it is well to take time to waken
thoroughly, so as to aim your best. If then you
fire and kill, you are contented for an hour or two.
There might then even be a little danger for
you, if you had made a bargain with the Devil
like Faust’s (see Goethe’s text, <span class="nw">Scene <span class="smc">iv</span>)—</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But even in that case, the danger would be momentary.
“Another” and “another” you would want;
and the Devil himself could not provide them—at
any rate in Burma, where the many ineffectual
days and nights become intolerable, unless you
have something else to do as well.</p>

<p>Accordingly it is the Forest officers, whose work
is in the woods, who can hunt to most advantage.
There was one I knew who killed many scores of
tigers, mostly by “sitting up over a kill,” in the
<a name="pg_207" id="pg_207" href="#pg_207"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>207<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>manner described. I doubt if he knew the exact
figure himself. It must have been over a hundred.
Besides the tigers, the same man killed perhaps
every kind of wild beast in the Burman forests,
except only the big ape.</p>

<p>Here, it may be noted, for the information of
those who deny the existence of that animal on
the Continent, that the writer knew a Mr Bruce,
Deputy Conservator of Forests, and a completely
credible man, who found his camp-followers
attacked by a big ape. To save human life, he shot
it, and on laying out the corpse he found it little
smaller than the orang-outang. This was in the
Upper Chindwin, in the north of Burma; and the
villagers, who professed to know it well, called it
the “wild man of the woods,” which is what
orang-outang means in the Malay language.</p>

<p>“I would have done something else,” said the
man of many trophies to me. “I would not have
shot the big ape—at least not within many years
past. I once did shoot a monkey in a tree. I
used small shot that lacerated its bowels. The
poor little beast sat on the bough and held its
protruding entrails in its hand and looked at me.
I felt as if it was asking me ‘Why did you do
that?’ I swore I’d never kill a monkey again,
and never did, and never will.”</p>

<p><a name="pg_208" id="pg_208" href="#pg_208"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>208<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>This reminds one of the common report, which
one would like to believe, that a great man of
science is occasionally haunted by the ghosts of
the apes he has slain. The generous man is
prone to remorse. But it is vain. “You can’t
cure the wounds your arrow has made by merely
unbending your bow.”</p>

<p>What most needs to be told, however, for it is
least suspected, is that with modern weapons and
a little skill and nerve, the hunter never has to
face much danger. Even accidents are rare, and
mostly avoidable. There is little to fear, except
monotony and malaria; and green mosquito-nets
have long been available for hunters to diminish
the malaria. How to diminish the monotony is a
problem that remains unsolved.</p>

<p>In India there is less of it—I mean of the
monotony. The patchiness of the forests makes
the killing of cats more expeditious in India than
in Burma. The poor labourers who “beat” have
a little involuntary excitement. There is some
real danger for them; but for nobody else. The
potentates aloft, on elephants or other elevations,
waiting to pull triggers, which is their function, are
as safe as if they were on the bridge of a battleship,
bombarding whales. The ladies could do it
equally well; or the ladies’ maids. The expense
<a name="pg_209" id="pg_209" href="#pg_209"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>209<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>is multiplied a hundred or a thousand times, to
increase the amusement; and that is the fashionable
Indian tiger-hunting. It differs from ordinary
hunting as the Spanish bull-ring differs from the
slaughter-house; but, as there is room for
thousands to sit in safety round the Spanish circus,
and a display of courage and agility by the leading
actors, a Spaniard might reasonably argue that
his sort of sport was superior in every way. It
certainly does supply more fun for the money.</p>


<h3 title="4. The Happy Hunter">4. THE HAPPY HUNTER</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> happiest huntsman I ever heard of was
a fat little Frenchman, who was a guest in
a shooting-box in the Highlands of Scotland. His
host was some ex-royalty; and one morning the
whole crowd were going to stalk the deer, except
our hero, who stood watching their departure as
cheerily as he could. “Take a gun and potter
about yourself near the house,” was the parting
shout to him; and after a little, finding time begin
to drag, he remembered the kindly-meant advice,
and shouldered a gun and went off alone.</p>

<p>At dinner-time, he could hardly contain himself
till the others had finished telling their doings;
<a name="pg_210" id="pg_210" href="#pg_210"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>210<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and when at last his hints had made them curious,
and they asked what sport he had had, he cried:
“Ah, my friends, smaller, but better than yours.
Just over the top of the first hillock (<i xml:lang="fra" lang="fra">petite colline</i>),
on the edge of the moor, I met a glorious herd
of Scottish chamois, magnificent wild sheep
(<i xml:lang="fra" lang="fra">moutons sauvages</i>), and killed half-a-dozen of
them before they escaped. They must have
watched you all go to a distance and felt safe. I
completely surprised them.”</p>

<p>It was only the conventions of sport that made
the fat little man ridiculous. The deer were no
more wild animals than the sheep. If the deer-stalkers
were real hunters, so was he. In danger
and in joy, they were the same.</p>

<p>They tell me that this story is well-known in
London. That was to be expected. It was too
good not to tell. But I heard it in 1894, in the
north, from a parish clergyman of superior character,
who located it in ground adjacent to his parish.
It is impossible that he lied. There is barely one
chance in ten that he was misinformed. So, if
the “French lord” concerned convinces me that
he desires such “immortality” as the mention of
his name would give, then his name shall be
mentioned, with perhaps a few more particulars.
The probabilities seem to me about ten to one
<a name="pg_211" id="pg_211" href="#pg_211"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>211<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that the story is true. After all, a statement is
not <em>necessarily</em> false, <em>because</em> it is known in
London.</p>

<p>The pleasure of fighting big cats any brave man
can feel. But wherein lies the joy of being what
Lord Chesterfield despised, a poulterer? Or of
butchering the deer? Why do we not all
feel as kind-hearted Plutarch did that, when
men are at play, the beasts that help in the
fun should have a share of it? Why is there
joy in dealing out death? God knows. I have
felt it myself; but a man cannot really analyse his
feelings. He can only pretend to do that. At
times—not always of course, but often enough—our
feelings are as mysterious as the stars, which
we can watch and photograph, but never explain.</p>

<p>So, when I say God knows, I mean that there
doubtless are in Nature, which is another name for
the mystery of the Universe, abundant reasons,
far beyond my sounding. And I do know a
partial explanation, a kind of clue, which our
mealy-mouthed manners make me hesitate to
mention. Yet, after all, truth needs no fine
excuses, and the sentiments of the natural man need
no apology. There is a genuine joy in killing.
Nobody needs to be ashamed of it, any more than
of sneezing. It is born in us all; and to a mind
<a name="pg_212" id="pg_212" href="#pg_212"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>212<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>undeveloped, unable to imagine itself in the place
of another, cruelty is a pure pleasure, the lively
sensations of it not being spoiled by pity.
That was how the Inquisitors enjoyed
themselves, and executions were always popular. A
man likes killing as naturally as he likes sugar.
“Clear your minds of cant,” as Dr Johnson advised,
and it is easy to see in that the true attraction of
hunting. How great and genuine a joy it is I
never realised till once I watched a lady crunching
a praying mantis under a paper-weight, and gloating
over its sufferings, just as a cousin of hers, a
famous hunter, loved to dwell on his more gory
glories. She was sipping a liqueur she liked a
minute later, with the same beatific expression of
happiness.</p>

<p>The good old salt, Frank Bullen, has lately been
lamenting the new and unromantic ways of whaling,
when the whales are chased by steamers and
the harpoons driven home by gunpowder, and the
whales quickly finished by bombs. Indeed, there
is no blinking the fact that the fun is out of the
business. A man should think himself a fool if
he goes on fancying that there is danger or romance,
when there is none. The whaler and the hunter,
under modern conditions, are as like the
old-fashioned whalers and hunters as the saloon
<a name="pg_213" id="pg_213" href="#pg_213"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>213<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>passengers in an Atlantic greyhound are like the
fellow-voyagers of Columbus or Drake.</p>


<h3 title="5. The Use of Hunting">5. THE USE OF HUNTING</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">To</span> talk of the use of hunting to-day is generally
cant, like talking of the danger of it.
At the expense of what is wasted in a few years
upon foxes in England, it would be possible to
exterminate the lions, tigers, leopards, wolves, foxes,
jaguars and every other big kind of dangerous
wild beasts on the face of the earth; and fewer
lives need be lost in the business than went to the
building of the Forth Bridge. The work might
be done in a year or two; and in the same time,
and still more cheaply—perhaps with a positive
profit—the deer and elephants and other wild
cattle might all be killed or tamed.</p>

<p>In Great Britain, of course, no planning would
be needed. The clearing of the game there shall
all be done for fun, “like winking,” as soon as the
many-headed king, the multitude, decides, if it
ever does decide, to end the Game Laws. It is in
the Indian and Burman and American and African
forests, and in the plateaux of Central Asia, that a
little planning and some expense would be required,
and a little brave work need to be done. Of course,
<a name="pg_214" id="pg_214" href="#pg_214"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>214<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the present writer is not advocating such a thing.
He is fond of cats; and loves wild Nature as well
as Nature tamed. But let us have no cant about
the business; and recognise what humanity can
do in <span class="allsc">A.D.</span> 1910.</p>

<p>What men go after big cats for is, in general,
amusement, just as much as when they go to shoot
pigeons; and the one kind of sport is intrinsically,
nowadays, no more dangerous than the other.
Hunting used to be a school of war; and so was
archery. Both arts are equally obsolete for any
such purpose. It is only among unwarlike peoples,
like the English or the Chinese, that such a thing
needs to be mentioned. Officers who go a-hunting
are not making themselves better able to lead
regiments in battle. It is well if the hunting does
not make them worse. There is nothing of military
art or science to be learned from sport.
Gunpowder and chemicals and machinery have ended
that, and made hunting to-day the same kind of
thing as golf, or cricket, or any other child’s play.</p>


<h3 title="6. Irresistible Evolution">6. IRRESISTIBLE EVOLUTION</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">I saw</span> a real hunter a few months ago (1908).
He was a Eurasian, in Burma, living from
hand to mouth. His clothes were of the roughest,
<a name="pg_215" id="pg_215" href="#pg_215"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>215<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>poor fellow, and his appearance showed he had to
live very barely. The police said that he was kept
alive by his patient mother, who “allowed him to
sponge upon her.” A passion for hunting had
withdrawn him from other occupations. The deer
in the woods, along the muddy coast, and the
rewards for an occasional leopard or tiger, I was
told, enabled him to buy ammunition and a little
food. He came before me with his companions,
some idle vagabond Burmans of like tastes,
because, it was alleged, when other game failed, they
had decided to become hunters of men—in plain
words, they were robbers. As I unravelled the
tangled threads of his history, I saw in it what any
man, who has developed healthily, can read in his
own consciousness, a summary of human evolution
from hunting to stealing. From stealing to working
is the next step. The hunters shall soon be all
vanished from the earth; but the thieves shall be
with us yet awhile.</p>

writings of Mr Wallace, the veteran natural philosopher,
still alive, who shares with Charles Darwin the honour of
proposing the theory of Natural Selection. His writings
not being at hand where this is written, his exact words
cannot be quoted; but certainly it was because he intimated
in some way how much was to be learned by the observation
of an adolescent orang-outang, domesticated under
natural conditions, that I undertook the upbringing and
education of a young gibbon when it was offered to me.
The results, for which much of the credit belongs to my

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Why</span> not? Are not our arms better than
wings, the implements of an inferior
species? A very slight knowledge of anatomy is
enough to let one know that nobody can have both
wings and arms. The why of that is inscrutable;
<a name="pg_217" id="pg_217" href="#pg_217"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>217<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>but the fact is undeniable. The Almighty has
written that in the skeletons of all creation.</p>

<p>What fools we are, when we try to improve on
the works of God! In His eyes, it is but as yesterday
since our parents, with bent backs and feeble
knees, came out of the wood, and, “hand in hand,
with wandering steps and slow,” they stumbled on
their humble human way. Fine roads and cars,
big houses and convenient clothes we have
procured ourselves; but let us not unwisely forget
our origin, nor fail to recognise the Mystery of
Mysteries, from which we emerged, and into which
we shall soon again subside.</p>

<p>There is something so ridiculous in human pride,
it is so silly as well as so sinful, that it is profitable
to dwell in thought upon the touches of Nature that
link us to our humbler kindred, even to those of
our monkey cousins, surviving still. Well might
Goethe glory, as we know he did, in his discovery
of the intermaxillary bone—the little bone which
the apes have between the jaws, but which men
were always supposed to lack, until the poet and
anatomist found it, latent and disused, but visible
yet in every son of man.</p>

<p>On this and many other such likenesses, it is
needless now to dwell. Encyclopædias are cheap,
and the works of Charles Darwin. Rather consider
<a name="pg_218" id="pg_218" href="#pg_218"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>218<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>what has been noticed less, and is equally remarkable,
the likenesses in feelings, habits and gestures,
which depend less upon the bones and muscles than
upon the nerves, and upon the spiritual springs,
still more impalpable than nerves.</p>

<p>In learning to swim, for example, the first lesson
is, do not lift the arms out of the water; for in
water or anywhere else, when men are excited, up
go their arms. This is not merely a conventional
stage gesture. It has become so, because it is
a spontaneous movement in real life. Why?
Surely, because our arboreal ancestors, whether it
was a lion in their way that frightened them or a
bull, would take to the trees, and the uplifted
arms were the first step to safety. Besides, the
little babies in the trees, long, long ago, had to
hang on to their mothers by their arms. The
whole significance of the gesture lies in its
spontaneity. It is by taking thought that we run.
We have to learn to walk, no less than to
dance; but the baby, newly born, lifts up his little
arms, and thinks of what he is doing no more than
does an adult in despair, or a drowning man that
is sinking in the sea.</p>

<p>Let Aristotle and Confucius say what they will
about the best road in the middle, the habits of
innumerable ages cannot be unlearned at dictation.
<a name="pg_219" id="pg_219" href="#pg_219"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>219<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>In the hour of danger men are apt to revert,
and grope for an escape upwards, like the apes,
feeling that that must be the right direction—Excelsior.
So “to the hills they lift their eyes”
and run, when hills are visible and trees are not.</p>

<p>It is not only in the hour of danger that we feel
this itching for altitude. It consoled the sailors
who had to climb the masts. At least, they
sometimes said so, singing with gusto,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>To this day it makes yachtsmen happy—at
least, some of them say so, and it is otherwise
not easy to understand their preference for cloths
stretched on poles to more efficient modern
machinery. Be that as it may, it is certainly the
itching for altitude that is the inherent part of
the pleasure of climbing knotted ropes and poles
and slippery mountain-sides, of drifting in balloons
like clouds, or whirring madly about like monstrous
mechanical partridges with motors in their bellies.
For myriads of ages, our noble ancestors looked
down upon things in general from the trees, and
the taste revives in us readily, and soon feels as
natural as winking.</p>

<p>So, if old fashions of decoration last, and a “coat

sky, he could choose no more appropriate emblem
than a noble little gibbon. The mighty muscles
of an orang-outang or gorilla might put a man
to shame, whereas the gibbon is much smaller
than ourselves. He is also the nimblest of all us
creatures with legs and arms, and in various ways
more like us than any of the others. So let the
emblem be a gibbon and a man clasping hands,

<p>It is a wonderful coincidence, which I know for a
fact, that the Burmese Buddhist gardeners used
phrases expressing similarly these identical sentiments.</p>

<p>The Christians were taught to feel differently.
So it was lucky for her that it was in a “heathen”
garden that the mother of our heroine was
trespassing one day in 1892. Running from the
sound of the approaching gardener, she escaped
with difficulty, and left her girl behind. Poor
frightened little mother, what a loss was there!
You never knew the fate of your child. You
never saw her any more at all.</p>

<p>The gardener carried the captured one in a
basket to my wife, who agreed to adopt her, and
named her Charlotte, or “Charlie” Darwin. For
immediate company of her own size, she had a
nice tabby, with whom she became quickly familiar.
The little cats in the woods survive by haunting
the trees, and doubtless live on terms of neutrality
with the monkeys and the apes. The big leopard
<a name="pg_222" id="pg_222" href="#pg_222"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>222<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>is the common enemy of both the little cats and
the monkeys. When once a suckling leopard,
the size of a kitten, was given us, and my wife
tried to coax a tabby to be wet nurse, and the cats
of the house were all standing round observant of
the stranger, the suckling gave a little leopard’s
growl, and instantly the cats were panic-stricken,
and fled to the roof, and stayed there long after
the departure of the suckling, till hunger brought
them down. The universal welcome these same
cats extended to Charlie showed that her tribe
was considered friendly. The first thing I
remember of her, perhaps, also, her earliest recollection
of our house, was her cheerfully dipping her
nose in the cats’ dish, and sharing their milk.</p>

<p>She never needed a wet nurse, being more than
half-grown when we received her. In fact, our
neighbour had caught her pulling plantains.
Among the common monkeys, the anxious mothers
seem to have a rule of thumb to keep their
young within reach, by using the tails as French
nursemaids use the leading-strings. “The length
of your tail, my child—no farther shall you go.”
But our Charlie was of the human-like species,
and no more had a tail than the reader himself.
Besides, she was old enough to be out of leading-strings.
Mother and daughter had been alike
<a name="pg_223" id="pg_223" href="#pg_223"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>223<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>absorbed in the fruit, and in an absent-minded
way had let the gardener surprise them. He said
he had never even flung a stone at a monkey, and
always been content to chase them away. So
Charlie Darwin and her mother had doubtless
been presuming on his good-nature, as females
are apt to do. But the sight of pretty Charlie
tempted him, and he knocked her down, with a
clod of earth, he said, and made her prisoner
unhurt.</p>

<p>She soon grew to her full height, swelling visibly
from week to week, almost from day to day, but
the full height of her tribe is below army requirements.
She was never much above two feet.
Next to the size, the chief difference between her
and the reader, if the reader is a girl, was that her
arms were proportionally longer and stronger, and
her legs shorter and weaker. Her Latin name
was Hylobates Hooluck; but, as she never went
to school, much less to college, it was never used.
And nobody spoke of her as a gibbon. Plain
“Charlie Darwin” she was always called, and
seemed to like it.</p>

<p>She was not proud, though, if she had been, she
might have been excused. The brightness of her
face made her a centre of attraction. She seemed
to dress well; for though she was never insulted
<a name="pg_224" id="pg_224" href="#pg_224"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>224<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with humanly manipulated rags, her beautiful fur
appeared to be like a perfectly fitting black satin
dress, of Oriental cut, and gave Miss Charlie Darwin
the look of a modest lady, at home in a drawing-room.
Her sparkling eyes, like moist beads, were
surmounted by big white eyebrows. These set
off her features so well that one could understand
why European ladies, in more leisurely days than
ours, took time to mark their faces with beauty
spots.</p>

<p>When moving or standing about in the drawing-room,
she tottered at times, and would put her
hand on anything convenient to support herself,
as many an old lady likes to do; and often she
would sit down, with a sigh of pleasure. But
Charlie did not sit long anywhere. Her restless
agility showed her youth. At tea-time, in
particular, she was very much alive. She was
devoted to fruit; but her natural good manners,
some said, her female curiosity, said others,
made her sample everything. She neglected the
plain bread but, like other young people, had an
almost undiscriminating love for cakes.
Shortbread was an exception. She was very partial
to it; and it was rare fun to give her none and
keep it out of easy reach, and watch the result.
She sat demurely unconcerned, as a woman can,
<a name="pg_225" id="pg_225" href="#pg_225"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>225<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>till she supposed she was unobserved. Then
swiftly and softly she ran to where it was, never
taking her eyes off the company, as if too
interested in what they were saying to think of
anything else; and deftly took the shortbread
and resumed her seat, as if it were a matter of
no consequence.</p>

<p>The only imperfection in her table manners
was her way of drinking from a saucer, lapping
her tea as the cats lapped milk. In vain my wife
showed her a better example. Habits of that
kind are easier to learn than to unlearn; and,
after all, men also drink in that way at times,
under primitive conditions, lapping of the water
with the tongue, as a dog lappeth. (See Judges
vii, 5.)</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Nothing</span> can really make up to a child for
the loss of a mother. True mother’s love
is like immeasurable space, and gives humanity
its first taste of the Infinite. The fishes know
it not, and hardly the crocodiles; but, as we move
up the scale of being, it comes more and more
into evidence. The rage of “a bear that has lost
her whelps” is proverbial. I had a friend in
<a name="pg_226" id="pg_226" href="#pg_226"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>226<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the Chitral expedition who told me that they
caught the children of an unlucky she-bear; and
the bereaved mother, “though she must have been
starving among the snows,” followed the army
for days, and the sentries had to be on the look-out
for her. She desisted at length, and probably
died there of starvation and despair.</p>

<p>Among our poor cousins, the apes, there is
many a mother might put to shame alike the
drabs of the slums and the fashionable females of
the decadent sets. So it was not strange that
Charlie Darwin moped. Though her stomach
was well filled, she had lost her mother.</p>

<p>Her mother was not the whole of her loss. She
had lost her clan; for these little beings live
together, and the germs of human society are
visible in their associations “for better or worse.”
The human soul can no more develop in solitude
than a tree can grow in a vacuum; and in the
same way little Charlie seemed to feel an aching
void. Repeatedly, in the early weeks after she
came to us, she would go to sit on one of the
trees on the edge of the compound (or yard); and
there she would long remain motionless, gazing
across the road to the woods from which she had
come. At other times, she would go to the other
side of the yard, and sit and gaze across the river,
<a name="pg_227" id="pg_227" href="#pg_227"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>227<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at forests on the farther side. “Where can they all
be? Oh, where’s my mother?” Her hankering
for what she had lost for ever was so plain that
we were not surprised when she went away to
look for them all.</p>

<p>She was absent for several days. Except that
she was not in any of the other gardens or
adjacent woods, nothing was ever known of her
whereabouts. Many pairs of sharp eyes were
watching for her in many directions, to earn a
good reward; but nobody earned it. She came
back herself. Early one morning it was reported
that she was in the tree at the door, the tree where
she generally ended in returning from a round in
the garden. Her custom had been to come to
the ground there and walk across the road and
run upstairs. But her natural awkwardness after
such an absence, and possibly her uncertainty
about the reception she might expect, made her
stay in the tree this morning. A servant climbed
to fetch her down, and she bit him. She
descended to within a few yards of the ground to
speak to me, though it was only “Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo!”
But as soon as she saw my wife coming
down the stairs she hurried to meet her. It was
really like a child coming home. My wife handed
her a plantain, and she at once began to eat.
<a name="pg_228" id="pg_228" href="#pg_228"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>228<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Then holding it in her right hand, and biting at
it, she gave her left hand to my wife; and in
that way they went upstairs together.</p>

<p>Charlie was too busy eating to say much that
forenoon; and, when she did speak, her words
were like water spilt upon the ground. “Words,”
I say; for I do think it likely that her multitudinous
intonations, if intelligible to us—that is to
say, if we had understood them as her mother
could have done—would have had the effect of
words. But we could not understand her, at
least not well, though my wife, perhaps taking
pity upon my curiosity, declared she could
gather that Charlie had had a hard time, and
travelled a great deal, and got little to eat, and
failed to find any of her relations; and that she
was minded now to be content with my wife for
a mother, and make friends with humanity, and
never run away any more. And, certainly, she
never did.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">There</span> is an excellent man in Burma who is
said to have lived many years upon nuts;
and an acquaintance of his told me he had been led
to the discovery that this was the ideal food, by the
<a name="pg_229" id="pg_229" href="#pg_229"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>229<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>consideration that nuts must be the staple food of
monkeys. I suggested to vary his diet by a
regular consumption of ants. Charlie was very
fond of them. She would even pause in eating
cake to pick up an ant if she saw one. I doubt if
she would have done so for a nut. She used to
pick up any ant, even the smallest, with finger and
thumb with the utmost facility, and put the prize
between her fine teeth and crunch it.</p>

<p>My wife had an egg in her hand one day on
the veranda when she was talking to Charlie,
who was sitting on the veranda rail. With
sudden alacrity, Charlie grabbed the egg, and,
holding it with both hands, tried to break the shell
with her teeth. She failed. It is likely all the
eggs she had received from her mother in the
woods had thinner shells than those of hens, and
so she did not think of using much force. She
turned the big egg round and round in her hands
with looks of astonishment; and then, in a
business-like way, as if she knew there was just
one thing to be done, she broke it on the veranda
railing on which she was sitting, and guzzled the
contents with such gusto that she smeared her
face and soiled her dainty fur with the yoke. The
next time she received an egg she was supplied
with a saucer to break it in; but never disguised
<a name="pg_230" id="pg_230" href="#pg_230"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>230<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>her preference for the primitive way of doing she
had learned in the woods. So, to make her use
the saucer, my wife had herself to break the egg.</p>

<p>The plan of education adopted was in the style
of Rabelais. “Do what you like,” was the first
commandment. Or she might be said to have
accepted Goethe’s gospel of self-culture, for she
“developed” diligently. She never was teased by
any kind of collars, chains, or bonds. There was
never any restriction upon her, except that of
hunger, which tethers us all, and in satisfying her
hunger she could do what she liked.</p>

<p>While the house was liberty hall to her, and
milk and fruit and rice and cakes and, in short,
the necessaries of civilised life were there, the
garden was in dry weather preferred, except of
course at tea-time, and at night. Of roses and
orchids she could have said what the toper said
of beer—she may have had too much, but
never enough. To be quite candid, she eyed the
opening buds as boys eye fruit. She seldom waited
till they bloomed fully before she ate them. When
such visitors as native ladies had natural flowers
in their top decorations, they had to be warned
against Charlie’s attentions. It was funny to see
her grave little face looking up at the lady caressing
her, while the long, lithe arm was reached furtively
<a name="pg_231" id="pg_231" href="#pg_231"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>231<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>round to the top or back of the lady’s head, and
the pretty flower there was deftly detached and
brought to Charlie’s lips, without any pretence of
chivalry.</p>

<p>One bad result of liberty, which happily did not
take place, was suggested by the sad fate of a
common brown monkey in Rangoon. It lived in
the garden of a friend of mine, not far from the
Scots Church, and was quiet and respectable until
it took to drink. Everything was done to reclaim
it, and it was on the road to a complete reformation,
when it unfortunately discovered, at the top
of a toddy-palm near where it lived, a pot into
which a good deal of toddy had run. It could not
resist the sudden temptation, and drank so much
that it fell from the tree and broke its neck. It is
well known that baboons are often sots, and the
little brown monkeys are at times no better.
Great, therefore, was my relief to see that Charlie,
after sniffing the wines and spirits in the decanters
one day, showed plainly that she did not like the
smell. There were toddy-palms near our house
too, but nothing ever induced her to try the effect
of alcohol. In this matter, the saving clause, it
now strikes me, was that there never was alcohol
on the table till dinner-time, and by that time she
was always asleep. The force of example is
<a name="pg_232" id="pg_232" href="#pg_232"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>232<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>very great on these little bits of men and women,
a susceptibility of theirs which is one of their most
human characteristics. I once heard a man boasting
of having seduced a pet monkey into carousing
with him, and drinking beer enough to have a
headache in the morning, “just like master.”
Charlie was never so tempted.</p>

<p>Our house was an old-fashioned, comfortable
wooden building, all on one floor, and the floor about
10 feet above the ground, with a deep roof made
of wooden shingles. When Charlie decided to run
away no more she selected as her sleeping-place
a part of the eaves with a convenient view of the
interior, and yet far enough from the wall to be
out of reach of anybody but a monkey or a bird.
Unfortunately (for themselves) our pigeons had
deserted their own little house and settled where
Charlie decided to sleep. It was interesting and
easy to watch what happened. Charlie took what
room she wanted, and ignored their existence.
For some weeks, I think, they lived together
peaceably. Then the birds discovered that their
new neighbour was fond of pigeons’ eggs, and
went away, not because they were meek, for
pigeons are pugnacious birds, but because they
could not defend their nests.</p>

<p>Another gibbon known to me in Burma was less<!-- final “s” invisible in original -->
<a name="pg_233" id="pg_233" href="#pg_233"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>233<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fortunate in his dealings with “our feathered
friends.” He was so young and inexperienced
that he treated crows as Charlie treated the
pigeons, and was mobbed by them to such purpose
that long afterwards, when he was full-grown and
able to go with his mistress to the tennis-court,
holding on by her skirts, or hand in hand with her,
it was a favourite joke of wicked men to cry,
“Caw-caw-caw.” Thereat, in ecstasies of alarm,
the little man deserted his mistress, and ran and
hid himself under the nearest bush. Luckily for
Charlie, there were no crows in our yard, only
pigeons, whom she could push aside with impunity.
They accepted their fate, and the place where they
had lived so long knew them no more.</p>

<p>It was curious to see little Charlie, so weak that
she trembled at a dog if it came within reach of
her, thus exercising the law of the jungle, that
might is right, on what was weaker still.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Charlie’s</span> favourite seat was upon the
veranda rail. It gave her a wide and
beautiful view of the garden and the river and
forests, to say nothing of the far-off mountains
<a name="pg_234" id="pg_234" href="#pg_234"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>234<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>blue, her native home, for Hylobates Hooluck is
by choice a mountaineer. Indoors, without moving
more than her head, by merely looking round,
she could see the drawing-room, whereof the
veranda was an extension, and, through wide doorways
never closed, the much more interesting
dining-room beyond.</p>

<p>Dr Clark, once famous as Gladstone’s physician,
is said to have been fond of telling how he watched
a little girl sitting in front of a fire, to which a
footman brought coals. The man took no notice
of her till she coughed violently; and then he
looked round, and a few kind words passed.</p>

<p>“Why did you cough?“ asked the doctor, when
the man had gone.</p>

<p>“To make James look at me,” said the candid
child; but it is surprising in a man like Clark that
he is said to have quoted this as an indication
of the <em>inferiority</em> of women. If he really did
so, it was because he had not thought the matter
out, and was confused by words. The difference
between men and women is one of kind, not of
degree. It is not a difference of less or more, but
of sex. A million women could not make one
man; but neither could a million men make one
women.</p>

<p>Now it is true that a normal little boy, sitting
<a name="pg_235" id="pg_235" href="#pg_235"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>235<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>where the girl sat, would not have felt an inclination
to attract the attention of a maid, mending
the fire; and it is true that normal little girls are
continually acting as the doctor saw that little one
act. The gentle sex spontaneously craves to be
noticed by the other. Why? Surely, because they
have been specialised in character no less than in
physical form for domestic life; and their essential
business ever is to study and humour the men,
whose function is to feed and protect them and
their children. “He for God only, she for God in
him,” remains as true as gravitation, even if we
fling the Hebrew Bible aside, and give the great
Reality some other name.</p>

<p>That this specialisation of sex comes from a
far-off date was curiously manifested by our little
Charlie. Indeed it was easy to see, and easy to
verify by observation in the hills, that “her people”
lived under social arrangements like the patriarchal
family. Sir Henry Maine, if he had known it,
might have reinforced his argument on ancient law
from an antiquity manifested by the habits of these
small people, compared to which the oldest days
of Rome were but as yesterday. So completely
womanly was our pet that many of her doings
were conundrums to masculine wits. It takes a
woman to understand a woman. He was a wiser
<a name="pg_236" id="pg_236" href="#pg_236"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>236<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>man than usual who said—“When I say I know
women, I mean that I know I don’t know them.”</p>

<p>Perhaps no man could ever have guessed what
Charlie found amiss with our fine tom-cat. “Don’t
you see? Tom takes no notice of her,” it was
explained. “He ignores her existence.”</p>

<p>Tom’s manners were simply perfect Piccadilly.
If Charlie had been conventional middle-class
English, she would have been humbled. If French
or German, she might have been amused or angry,
according to circumstances. Being as irrepressibly
democratic as the Burmans and Mongolians
in general, she was simply puzzled; and in playing
at tig or some other game with the other
cats, which was a habit of hers, she might often
be observed to be watching Tom with a
perplexed look, like a kindly teacher “taking stock”
of a backward pupil. Tom never looked at her.</p>

<p>One day, as she sat on the veranda rail, she
was seen to be intently studying him. He lay
motionless, as if asleep, under an easy chair, his
tail projecting far. She leapt lightly down to
the floor, ran noiselessly along it, as if on tip-toe,
and was in the act of reaching forth her hand to
the tail, when Tom sprang to attention, and the
threatened tail began to swell and sway from
side to side in the air. Unabashed, (for indeed
<a name="pg_237" id="pg_237" href="#pg_237"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>237<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I never saw her abashed, only frightened, and
on this occasion she was not frightened), she
gleefully ran round the chair, chasing the tail,
with merry cries of “Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo!”</p>

<p>Tom sulkily turned one way and another, keeping
his tail out of reach, and visibly perplexed.
Charlie enjoyed the game immensely. It lasted
a long time, and then Tom lost patience, and
thrust out his paw, with the claws extended.</p>

<p>He could hardly have hoped to touch her. He
might as easily have caught a swallow. The
claws did not come within five inches of her;
but the savage gesture was an outrage to her
feelings. She ejaculated what sounded like a
squeak, but perhaps should be called a scream;
and as he remained callous and far from apologetic,
she turned her back upon the clown and
resumed her seat upon the rail. Tom, for his
part, with a greater air of dignity than usual, if
possible, the sacred tail uplifted inviolate, that
is to say, untouched, stalked grandly away; but
he had not gone two yards before Charlie leapt
upon the floor again, as noiseless as a shadow,
and swift “as arrow from a bow,” she darted after
him and seized the end of his tail between her
finger and thumb. She seemed to pinch it, and
certainly gave it a sharp tug; and then, like
<a name="pg_238" id="pg_238" href="#pg_238"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>238<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>magic, when Tom whirled round, she was sitting
on the rail again, making faces at him, and
audibly chuckling in the intervals of triumphant
hooting, “Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo!”</p>

<p>He gazed at her awhile in bewilderment, and
moved away.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Ever</span> after she returned from seeking her
mother, Charlie eyed the woods like a
frightened child, and vehemently plumped for
civilisation. No wonder! Death is ever at hand
for all beings; but in the woods it seems to press
upon you. The very tigers have a recurring
prospect of death by starvation, a fact which
should mitigate our hatred of them, while
confirming our hostility. The Lilliputian tribe of
gibbons have lively days, quite full of trouble.
They are so human, and yet so much weaker
than humanity, struggling to save their carcasses
from leopards and Christians by sheer agility
and co-operation, living from hand to mouth,
<a name="pg_239" id="pg_239" href="#pg_239"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>239<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>picking from the bushes what they can, where
any bush may hide a mortal enemy.</p>

<p>I had noticed among the hills that one heard
nothing of them at nights; and, watching Charlie’s
ways, I soon saw why. Having found a cozy
corner for herself in the eaves, at the expense
of the pigeons, she retired to it at dark, as
regularly as Shakespeare’s ploughman. She,
“with a body filled and vacant mind, got her to
rest, ... never saw horrid night, the child of
Hell, slept in <span class="nw">Elysium....”</span></p>

<p>She detested lamps more than Ruskin did
steam-engines. He sometimes went in trains.
She would have nothing to do with lamps. She—went
to bed. Vain was it to light her roost
and offer fruit of the most attractive quality.
You could set the cocks a-crowing with your
artificial dawn; but Charlie knew too much. She
lifted her head, and that was all. She looked
at you a second or two, blinking sleepily; and
turned to rest again. We are children of the
light, the apes and we, no less than children of
the air; and Charlie would not quit her sleeping
place until the sun relit the world.</p>

<p>Then she rose and came into our room for
fruit. In a country near the Equator, like Lower
Burma, sunrise and sunset fall between five and
<a name="pg_240" id="pg_240" href="#pg_240"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>240<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>seven o’clock all the year round; and Charlie’s
hours differed little from those of the villagers.
So she came in with the dawn and the morning
coffee; but, at that early hour, she would take
nothing but fruit, perhaps because she was in a
hurry to go out of doors. She did not even give
us her company while she was eating. Fruit in
hand, she toddled out and away.</p>

<p>She always toddled on the floor, like a child,
when she went slowly; but her usual gait was a
light run, such as they now practise in some
Continental armies, as the least fatiguing way for
infantry to cover the ground at times, especially
going downhill. You bend forward a little (how
much, depends on your centre of gravity), and
trot, trot, trot, never straightening the legs. I
saw the crew of H.M.S. <cite>Devastation</cite> running
about in that way, during some manœuvres in
the seventies, and heard men talking of it as “a
way we have in the navy, keeps the boys awake,
we never walk.” So I would have claimed the
discovery for the British navy, when a foreign
doctor claimed to have invented it, if I had not
known that both had been forestalled long ago
by the little apes.</p>

<p>Necessity had doubtless been the mother of
invention for them, as it is so often for us. These
<a name="pg_241" id="pg_241" href="#pg_241"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>241<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>little creatures dare not walk in the woods, as
men and big apes can do. When on the ground
they have to run for their lives, at the top of their
speed. Up in the trees they are safe from a
tiger, and even from a leopard, as a rule, if they
see him. But on the ground there is no beast
needs do them reverence. The smallest adult
jungle dog could singly kill the sturdiest of
gibbons. That was why Charlie had learned
from her mother to trot like a man-of-war’s
man on any flat surface.</p>

<p>When I paid a morning visit to the stable,
she often met me there. She had not walked
across the compound; but from some high tree
had noticed me and come whirling down. I
have seen her rub her hand upon the pony’s rock-salt,
and then put it to her lips and look at me
making various inviting sounds, as if to say,
“Try this; it’s not at all bad.” At other
times, like a child, she put grain between her
teeth and crunched it. I think I have seen her
spit it out; but cannot remember seeing her
swallow it.</p>

<p>She would accompany me as far as the gate,
I on the ground, she up aloft, and rather quicker
for the short distance; but she stopped at the
edge of the compound, looking timidly at the
<a name="pg_242" id="pg_242" href="#pg_242"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>242<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>woods on the farther side of the road, and never
venturing beyond the fence.</p>

<p>Towards eight o’clock, I was told, she was
generally among the trees near the gate, where
she had a view of the roads by which I would
return; but it was not a matter of personal
affection. Whenever she saw me in the distance,
she knew that breakfast would be ready in half an
hour, and hastened indoors to look round, having
a fine youthful appetite, freshened by exercise.
Her business-like, straight return journey was
considered so safe a sign that I was in sight
that the cook believed her rather than the clock.
The explanation was that breakfast was required
at an irregular time, between nine and ten, but
regularly about half an hour after my return. So
Charlie was pronounced “really useful.”</p>


<h3 title="7. Table Manners">7. TABLE MANNERS</h3><!-- final period removed for consistency -->

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">When</span> we were at dinner she was always
asleep; but, with equal regularity, she
was always impatiently awaiting us at the
breakfast table.</p>

<p>A chair was set for her, of course, but never
used, except as a stepping-stone to the table. It
<a name="pg_243" id="pg_243" href="#pg_243"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>243<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>did not suit her size, and we did not have one
specially made for her, as the giants did for
Gulliver. She so obviously did not want it that
it would have been superfluous.</p>

<p>The knives and forks she examined curiously,
but without admiration. Like the Asiatics of old,
she kept or made her fingers clean enough to eat
with, and desired no better implements. I never
saw her use a spoon, except to rap on the
table.</p>

<p>Sitting upon the table, she faced my wife and
watched her, as if she felt, but in a friendly
way, as Frederick the Great felt towards the
Emperor Joseph, whose portrait he kept in view,
saying, “That is the person to keep mine eye
upon.”</p>

<p>Though clever at imitation, she adhered to her
own ways of eating and drinking, and did not
imitate ours. This may have been because her
habits of that kind were fixed before she came to
us; but we thought her way of lapping was like
the cat’s.</p>

<p>She did not remain seated upon the table, but
walked about upon it, like a <i xml:lang="fra" lang="fra">petite</i> Madame Sans-Gêne,
or little Miss Free-and-Easy. At first she
was circumspect in her movements and did no
damage. But familiarity brings carelessness, and
<a name="pg_244" id="pg_244" href="#pg_244"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>carelessness catastrophes. As the Chinese say,

<p class="noindent">So the day came when she tripped, and there was
a loud smash. Then she whisked herself to the
pole of a curtain hanging near. So quick she
went that observers could not agree whether she
touched the curtain on the way, or mounted with
a hop, skip and jump.</p>

<p>Once there, she found that that perch had great
natural advantages. It commanded a complete
view of the back premises as well as the dining-room,
and yet was not many yards from the
table. So she always stayed there, for choice,
afterwards.</p>

<p>The place visibly pleased her from its elevation.
She liked looking down, and disliked looking up.
She showed her preference with a naïve candour
that left no room for doubt, and has always seemed
to me to illustrate and illuminate the laws of
Society.</p>

<p>Of course, she was regularly served. Whatever
she called for was handed up. And more than
once I recollect that we affected to forget her, and
did not look at her or heed her. Then down she
<a name="pg_245" id="pg_245" href="#pg_245"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>245<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>came, and walked about on the table, helping
herself and chattering in our faces, with many a
grimace and “Oo-oo-oo,” our small, black Madame
Sans-Gêne, with the big white eyebrows, the little
Miss Free-and-Easy.</p>


<h3 title="8. Dogs">8. DOGS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Once</span> it happened that Charlie was left in
charge of a neighbour, as she was young
and we had to go from home; and in the neighbour’s
house a dog bit her. When next she saw
my wife she flung her arms round my wife’s neck,
and clung to her with sobs and moans, and all the
gestures natural to her sex in affliction, and ever
afterwards she seemed to feel that dogs were
hostile.</p>

<p>I recollect that once our house was filled with
visitors, some local tin-god and official attendants,
and one of the aforesaid attendants had a bright
little terrier at his heels. Poor dog, his master
could not silence the irreverent barkings that
interrupted even the divinity his master was attending.
Cuffs and kicks were useless. Charlie, up aloft,
had fixed the terrier with her glittering eye, and
“Oo-oo-oo-ed” at him till he was frantic. When
<a name="pg_246" id="pg_246" href="#pg_246"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>246<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he was thrashed into a moment’s silence, and she
saw she was observed, she nimbly scuttled away
among the upper carpentry, only to reappear in a
few seconds elsewhere, and catch the dog’s eye
again, and “Oo-oo-oo” at him afresh; and then
the barking recommenced, and the inevitable
beating and yelping, which she seemed to enjoy
immensely.</p>


<h3 title="9. Equality is Equity">9. EQUALITY IS EQUITY</h3>

<p class="drop-cap-A"><span class="uc">Although</span> she went about on her hind legs,
as we do, she did not despise her four-footed
acquaintances, and was always intimate with the
tabby, to whom she had been introduced on
arrival. It was a pretty sight to watch them dip
their little heads together into the saucer of milk.
They always started fair, but pussy lapped the
better. The milk diminished so fast that Charlie
could see that her share would be the smaller one
at that rate. Then tenderly but irresistibly she
put her strong right arm round pussy’s neck and
pulled her back, out of reach of the saucer.
Charlie went on lapping herself, looking round
often at the cat, winking vigorously with both
eyes, and uttering various friendly vowel sounds.
Here, perhaps, it had better be noted, for the
<a name="pg_247" id="pg_247" href="#pg_247"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>247<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>information of philologists, that hers was exclusively
a vowel language. I never heard her sound a
consonant. It would therefore have been difficult
to represent it phonetically. The modulations of
tones were too delicate for an Aryan ear; but a
Chinaman might have been more successful, and
my Burmans caught them well. Her meaning could
best have been recorded by ideograms, like the
oldest of the Chinese or Egyptian hieroglyphs.
But there was no use for such a thing. She did
not need it, and would not have learned it.</p>

<p>It was probably the accompanying gestures that
made pussy understand her. To be pulled back
from the saucer, and tightly held out of reach of
it, is what may be called an unmistakable hint.
Puss acquiesced. When Charlie thought their
shares had been equalled she relaxed the embrace,
and puss began again; but though she resumed
drinking in a polite, deferential way, as if saying,
“By your leave, ma’am,” puss never abated her
speed of lapping, and so had soon to be withdrawn
once more. Occasionally this took place
as often as three or four times in the emptying
of one saucer; and seldom did it fail to happen
once. In fact I noticed that at length they used
to <em>begin</em> operations with Charlie’s arm upon
pussy’s neck, ready for action. Day after day
<a name="pg_248" id="pg_248" href="#pg_248"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>248<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>this went on. Puss never struggled. When the
milk was thus equally finished they parted friends.
The great rule of equity law, that “Equality is
equity,” was never better practised; and so
profoundly is it in accordance with the nature of
things that even a cat can understand it, when
constrained.</p>


<h3 title="10. Where Civilisation Began">10. WHERE CIVILISATION BEGAN</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">But</span> where had Charlie learned that “Equality
is equity,” a rule that has been found beyond
the grasp of a “common”-minded chancellor?
Surely, in the family circle. Her whole character,
and, in particular, the readiness to imitate, upon
which I do not dwell only because everybody
knows that kind of thing, was that of one who had
inherited family instincts, whose ancestors had
lived in families for immemorial generations. The
habits of living species are slowly modified in the
lapse of millenniums; and we were not teaching
Charlie tricks, but letting her develop naturally,
and observing her.</p>

<p>The mention of imitation reminds me that
Charlie could handle my wife’s hand-mirror as
well as any lady; but the first sight of it raised
<a name="pg_249" id="pg_249" href="#pg_249"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>249<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hopes that were disappointed. She was seen to be
moving it back and forward with one hand, while
with the other she was groping behind it, until at
last she was satisfied that there was no other
gibbon there. The great life-sorrow of Charlie
was that she never saw another like herself again.
It was pathetic to see her looking in the mirror,
and then at other inmates of the house, as if asking
herself, “Why am I so different?” She was like
Robinson Crusoe, without a chance of deliverance;
or she might be compared to Gulliver among the
giants. Though in proportion not so small as he
was, she was too small to feel at home or among
equals; and for animals as for men to be weak is
to be miserable, and strength and weakness are
largely matters of comparison. We petted her so
that she did not feel that much; and though
nothing could supply the lack of kindred beings,
the lapse of time benumbed the pain, and she was
consoled.</p>

<p>One of the best-known bits of English literature
is the sentence which keeps the memory of old
Hobbes green, his fancy picture of a state of
<span class="nw">Nature.—</span></p>


<p class="tb"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>“No arts, no letters, no society, and which is
<a name="pg_250" id="pg_250" href="#pg_250"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>250<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>worst of all” (especially for philosophers),
“continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life
of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”</p>

<p>The great mistake in this nightmare description
is the supposition that men were ever solitary by
natural habits. Never, never, O Hobbes, since
men began to be, never but in artificial conglomerations
defying the laws of Nature, and dying in
consequence, never did men and women stand
alone. Individualism in its extreme form is
actual insanity. In moderate forms it has always
been common. It fills our jails to-day. It is
almost universal among the cat tribes; but wherever
and whenever it spreads among men it leads
to death. The most primitive of human creatures
ever known to maintain themselves have been
found to live in families. The human apes, nay,
the very baboons do likewise. So it is contrary to
science or sifted common-sense to think of our
arboreal ancestors as solitaries.</p>

<p>What probably misled Hobbes was the remark
of Tacitus, in his <cite>Germany</cite> (XVI), that the
Germans, who may have seemed to Hobbes, as to
a great French historian, “the last arrived of the
barbarians,” lived “scattered and apart, just as a
spring, a meadow, or a wood has attracted them.”
But Tacitus goes on to tell how they lived in
<a name="pg_251" id="pg_251" href="#pg_251"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>251<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>villages, and were united in tribes or clans, just
like the people of Afghanistan both then and now,
or the Highland clans till the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>What misled Hobbes is matter of conjecture.
That he was mistaken is certain. It would be
contrary to all analogies based on our existing
knowledge, that is to say, it would be sheer
hallucination to imagine that, between our cousins
the human apes, and primitive humanity, who both
live in families, there was a different kind of
creatures in human form, who lived like cats, each
for himself, and every man against everybody else.
Hobbes, himself, if he were alive to-day, would
laugh at that, and in the light of new knowledge
he would be the first to allow that, though life in
a state of Nature has its drawbacks, solitude was
never one of them. Civilisation is the art of living
together; and it commenced with family life in
immemorial antiquity, before we left the trees,
so that it may be said to be older than humanity
itself.</p>


<h3 title="11. Filial Feeling">11. FILIAL FEELING</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">It</span> is a common remark of Japanese philosophers,
applying Western science to their Eastern
histories, that filial affection is unknown to
<a name="pg_252" id="pg_252" href="#pg_252"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>252<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the beasts, and the last feeling to develop
in spiritual evolution, and consequently the
first to deteriorate. That is how they have
been known to explain the moral inferiority of
Western civilisation; for, as lawyers, on
legal-political questions, do always—of course in a
perfectly honourable manner—adapt their legal
principles to their politics, so do philosophers,
unconsciously, shape theories to suit their national
prejudices. Why not? A man whose trade is
words can find reasons for anything; but a man
who cares for nothing but the truth soon learns not
to theorise beyond his knowledge.</p>

<p>However, I never quarrel with anybody, least of
all with the philosophers. They can either
stretch their theory, or else say Charlie was
not a beast. One or other of these two things
they must do, when they know how she convinced
her sceptical master that she loved as a dutiful
child and was utterly devoted to the lady who
had received and fed and protected her—master’s
wife. A little girl who risks her life for her
stepmother is sure to be well furnished by nature
with filial piety.</p>

<p>Many were the experiments made to test this,
as soon as time enough had elapsed to let filial
affection germinate in Charlie, if the germ of it
<a name="pg_253" id="pg_253" href="#pg_253"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>253<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>were in her. My wife had long been sure of it, but
I was doubting yet, when an indisputable experiment
settled the question in Charlie’s favour, and
so, perhaps, gave her a place in history.</p>

<p>By the happiest of inspirations, one morning,
my wife began crying and sobbing while Charlie
was still within hearing, at the other end of the
house but not yet outside the eaves. “Pretend to
slap me,” she said, “and make a noise.”</p>

<p>I obeyed, and Charlie heard. Swift as a flash,
she reappeared on the partition wall, between the
bedroom and the dressing-room, and moving
restlessly upon it, with arms now and then uplifted in
distress, she “Oo-oo-oo-ed” at the top of her voice,
and made hideous grimaces at me, and uttered
guttural grunts we had never heard before, quite
German or Pathan in accent, noises that seemed to
emanate from the deepest depths of her being.</p>

<p>By the help of a mirror, I could see her without
directly looking at her. Finding threats and
expostulations unheeded, she took a leap of more
than two yards, and landed on the curtain poles of
the bed. I could not then pretend not to see her;
but, to her horror, I heeded her no more than
before. Then she made another big leap, and
landed on my shoulders, and, as I felt before I felt
her feet, clapped a hand upon each eye. If it had
<a name="pg_254" id="pg_254" href="#pg_254"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>254<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>been serious fighting, as she believed it was, she
might have had my eyes out before I was aware of
her movement—so quick was she, “like a needle.”
At least, she could have blinded me for the moment—at
the probable cost of her life. She had, in fact,
in her desperation, for my wife’s sake, ventured to
try the identical feat that Ulysses practised on the
cannibal monster Polyphemus, whom he blinded in
his cave. If one reflects that she could hardly
have weighed a stone, and the man she attacked
was rather above than below the average of men
in size and weight, one cannot refuse to her the
praise that properly belongs to a Jack-the-Giant-Killer
or tricky Ulysses.</p>

<p>That she was generally timid, as was natural for
her size and sex, merely clenches the argument
about her filial feeling. Say, if you like, that it
was excitement, half-hysterical, that did it. What
caused the excitement but her devotion?</p>

<p>Luckily for myself, I had been watching her
closely. My hands were on her little wrists in a
moment, and no harm was done; and my wife’s
caresses soon composed her.</p>

<p>I would gladly have repeated the experiment
oftener than was allowed, which was only after
long intervals about twice; and on every such
occasion, the whole drama was rehearsed, the small
<a name="pg_255" id="pg_255" href="#pg_255"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>255<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>spontaneous performer never failing to make her
death-defying leap. And every time she did it,
she was rewarded not with tit-bits only, but with
what children dearly love, a pleasant sight. My
wife thrashed me. Then Charlie laughed. She
rolled from side to side, as she sat on the
partition wall, as if “unable to contain herself.” She
“Oo-oo-oo-ed” approval, and danced for joy.</p>


<h3 title="12. Agreeable Sensations">12. AGREEABLE SENSATIONS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">In</span> the eighth book of his autobiography
(<cite xml:lang="ger" lang="ger">Dichtung</cite>, etc.), Goethe moralises that
“with the infinite idiosyncrasy of human nature
on the one side, and the infinite variety in the
modes of life and pleasure on the other, it is
a wonder that the human race has not worn
itself out long ago.” He explains the mystery
by a toughness which, it is now safe to say,
must have been inherited from our arboreal
ancestors, for Charlie had it in full measure.</p>

<p>The fact was that, when she grew up, she
suffered from <i xml:lang="fra" lang="fra">ennui</i>, and no wonder! She had
food without seeking it, and was safe from
the continual dangers that kept her lively and
busy in the woods. Without a husband “to
<a name="pg_256" id="pg_256" href="#pg_256"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>256<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>make her uneasy,” as the old song says, and
no children to work for, she was in the same
painful quandary as so many good maiden
ladies I know, whose “only labour is to kill the
time, and labour dire it is, and weary woe.”
Often enough it is not their fault, as it was
not Charlie’s.</p>

<p>To do her justice, Charlie set to work to
amuse herself, unhasting, unresting, in a way
worthy of Goethe’s disciple, and not only found
agreeable sensations for herself, but provided
them for her admirers.</p>

<p>As a child of Nature, she tolerated drawing-room
monotonies chiefly for the sake of cake
and shortbread; but she dearly loved to see
men coming to call, especially if, as generally
happened, they wore high headgear. Our house
had much open woodwork aloft, which suited
her as if it had been designed for her
convenience. After very little practice she was
able to send flying far the hat or turban of any
man coming up the front stairs. It added to
the joke that they had been duly warned against
<a name="pg_257" id="pg_257" href="#pg_257"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>257<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>her. She would show herself and move away
when looked at—the shy, innocent creature—but
it was only to another beam, where she was
unobserved, whence she could stoop upon the
passer-by, and with a dexterous touch uncover
him. The variety of expressions on the faces
of the men, as they looked up at the sweet
little cherub who was grinning aloft, was
perhaps as amusing to her as to anybody else.</p>

<p>There was a proud Mohammedan who swore
his turban should escape, and, flinging dignity
to the winds, desirous at any cost of scoring
over those whose headgears had descended, he
kept his hand on his. So Charlie’s usual
side-blow merely shook it. The man cried out
triumphant—too soon. With the quickness of
thought Charlie changed her tactics. Instead
of repeating the ineffectual side-stroke, she
caught the turban in the middle and pulled it
up. The man whirled round indignant, and
she dropped it at his feet with a grin. He
told her she was a heathen. She answered,
“Oo-oo-oo!”</p>

<p>To drop things from a height seemed a
perennial pleasure to her. That is a characteristic
of many monkeys, and, in many forms, is visible
in men and women. To keep to monkeys, I
<a name="pg_258" id="pg_258" href="#pg_258"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>258<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>recollect a playmate in the seventies who wept
with laughing as he told me how his pet
monkey, being driven in spite of his protests
out of the drawing-room, had taken refuge, poor
exile, in the kitchen. My friend was not allowed
to go into exile with him, and was bidden hold
his tongue when he called attention to alarming
noises. The monkey was meanwhile sitting
on the highest shelf in the kitchen, solacing his
solitude by pitching the best china of the household
upon the brick floor.</p>

<p>Among the most agreeable of the sensations
which Charlie was addicted to seeking was
that of sliding in a sitting posture—the “sitting
glissade” they call it in the Alps. She had no
snows, but contented herself with the boards,
upon the ridges and dips in our shingle roof.
From the highest apex of the roof to near the
eaves she came sliding down, pretty quick,
partly by force of gravity, partly by pushing
herself with her hands. Her hands clattered
and rattled on the shingle roof with a great
noise, which added to her joy. Once down to
near the eaves, she would stop and run to the
top again, with looks and cries like those of
boys sliding on the ice.</p>

<p>It is surely needless to multiply references to
<a name="pg_259" id="pg_259" href="#pg_259"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>259<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>show how human this spontaneous performance
was. As the Cimbrians came down the valley
of the Adige, about a hundred years before
Christ, the Romans saw with amazement the
barbarians, “almost naked among the ice,” says
the historian, as if reporting an eye-witness, sit
upon their shields and slide down the Alpine
slopes. There is no detail of these old wars
that sticks better in the memory than this, and
one is reminded of it by our new fashions of
adult sliding, so wonderfully like the sport of
the brave invading savages, two thousand years
ago.</p>

<p>As for her love of noise, nobody can call for
proof of the humanity of that. It is self-evident.</p>

<p>Even if the idealists are right who claim that
the only cure for <i xml:lang="fra" lang="fra">ennui</i>, and the only way to
peace of heart and mind, is the “love of God,”
or the “love of beauty,” or the “love of knowledge
and wisdom,” or “art,” which is not always
trumpery, or “music,” which is not always noise,
or whatever other name we give to the harmony
and the visions vouchsafed to the pure and
good and wise, not even the idealists, indeed
they least of all, can claim to be different in
kind from little Charlie. The difference is only
in degree. In her humble way, like an
<a name="pg_260" id="pg_260" href="#pg_260"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>260<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>inquisitive child, she was for ever investigating
things, stroking a tiger’s skin, for example, comparing
it with other materials on the floor,
turning back the cat’s outer ear and gazing
into it like a surgeon; touching, tasting,
handling, whatever was within her reach; for
ever on the outlook for anything fresh, like the
idle Athenians, who crowded round the first
preacher of salvation, in search of something
new. This universal craving of mankind is a
natural inheritance from busy forefathers who lived
aloft, and had to be continually on the look-out.
And as Charlie sometimes sat and dreamily
gazed upon the world in general, with a puzzled
look, and beheld with mingled joy and bewilderment
the glorious sun, she seemed to me
to be better qualified than any sophisticated
Athenian to pay real homage to the “Unknown
God.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Wondering</span>, if not worshipping, as she
blinked at the morning sun, Charlie
Darwin then and all the rest of the day was continually
giving opportunities of observation such as
would have rejoiced the heart of Wallace. The
<a name="pg_261" id="pg_261" href="#pg_261"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>261<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>gibbons in a Zoo are more out of their element
than men in a jail. They are surrounded by
strange sights and sounds, and stupefied and
quasi-paralysed by lack of occupation. We can
learn little more from them living there than from
their little bodies when they are dead. Nor are
pets more satisfactory. At any rate all others I
have seen, but Charlie, were too sophisticated.
You could no more learn from them their native
life, than you could learn the ways of English
children in the country by watching poor little
guttersnipes, who have never been out of
town.</p>

<p>But Charlie was the real wild maid of the woods,
the genuine gibbon, unadulterated. She never
needed to conform to our ways unless she saw fit
to do so, to please herself. It was live and let
live, on both sides. She was at home in every
sense. Cousins of hers, perhaps actual brothers
and sisters, or her bereaved mother, were roving
free, not very far away—as free as any wild beast
ever is, that is to say, living from hand to mouth
as usual, seeking provender. And after all, that is
how Nature first made <span class="nw">man—</span></p>

<p>One day as I was listening to mingled sounds from
<a name="pg_262" id="pg_262" href="#pg_262"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>262<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>across the river, thinking I heard the “Oo-oo-oos”
of the gibbons, mingled with dogs’ barking and
human cries, there seemed to be a look of recognition
on Charlie’s face, and she also listened; but
neither then nor at any time did she make a second
attempt to join her relatives, so that her master
began to hope that, perhaps, when she was older,
some likely bachelor of their clan might be
attracted to civilisation by her. It was quite
certain she would never revert. She had had her
fill of barbarism.</p>

<p>The melancholy moping of her first few days,
when she used to eye the woods, never
returned after it went away. From dawn to
dusk, her mercurial activity never ceased, and
that fact seemed to her master to illuminate
one of the most interesting problems in mental
evolution.</p>

have taught us that the best way to develop the
muscles is to use them frequently in gentle
exercises, avoiding great spasmodic efforts, which
strain and weaken them. The same law applies
to the mind. There was a Latin jingle to that
effect current long ago in schools, which is worth
preserving as a bit of old-fashioned wisdom. I
never saw it in print, but was taught it orally

<p>Assuming for the sake of brevity that the reader
agrees to this, which is a matter about which men
of sense are generally agreed, what has to be told
is that Charlie Darwin, our Charlie, illustrating
evolution without studying it, unconsciously
suggested that the approved method of steady and
gentle exertion was merely a continuation of
Nature’s way upwards, the identical way that
Nature took to bring the apes above the other
beasts, and then improve the apes. Their hands
provided a ready means of action for many
purposes, and their habits of diet, which made them
ever ready to eat, provided a perpetual supply of
motive power. The great progressive movement,
so begun, has never stopped. The restlessness
and the <i xml:lang="fra" lang="fra">ennui</i> which cause so many crimes and
follies are Nature’s impulse, misused or neglected.
<a name="pg_264" id="pg_264" href="#pg_264"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>264<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>It comes from habits older than the hills. It is
the vital force of each. With it, we may do evil, if
we will; but we can do nothing at all without it.
The cats can gorge themselves and sleep in
happiness and health; but Nature has made that
impossible for gibbons and for men.</p>

<p>Of course the only novelty here is the suggestion
that continual employment was Nature’s way of
stimulating the growth of the brain. The doctrine
that beings, with such brains as men and apes
have now, can find content and peace in healthy
occupation, and in no other way, is a very old
discovery; but, as there are many to whom
philosophy is folly written large, it may make
the truth more credible to them to mention
that Charlie’s habits proved this beyond a doubt,
and so corroborated the profoundest conclusion
of Aristotle (<cite>Ethics</cite>).</p>

<p>She also ratified the rhetoric of John Ruskin.
His declamations against the excessive division of
labour were the derision of practical people in the
nineteenth century. “Polishing the pins with
men’s souls! Bah!” With shrugs and sneers
they intimated that he was a lunatic. If he had
not been rich, he might have been jailed as an
incendiary. Rich or poor, he would have been in
danger anywhere but in free and happy England.
<a name="pg_265" id="pg_265" href="#pg_265"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>265<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>And now England’s patience is rewarded by the
discovery that Ruskin was essentially right. If
our brains have been developed by our innate
readiness to “turn our hands to anything,” then,
assuredly, to restrict activity to one or two
mechanical movements is to reverse the natural
process, and so torture the mind worse than the
constraining bandages torture the feet of Chinese
ladies. The damage done to vital organs in that
way cannot be compensated by any wages.</p>

<p>Thus were the conclusions of Aristotle and the
rhetoric of Ruskin reinforced by the example of
Charlie Darwin.</p>


<h3 title="14. The Last Chapter">14. THE LAST CHAPTER</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">By</span> May 1893, when Charlie had been about
a year in her master’s house, he had been
about two and a half years in the same station, in
charge of the same district, doing the same kind
of work. The average for the province was a few
months. So he should not have been surprised
that he was then, on the shortest possible notice,
transferred from where he was, in the Sittang
valley, in the east of Burma, to a district with
headquarters on Ramri Island, off the western
coast.</p>

<p><a name="pg_266" id="pg_266" href="#pg_266"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>266<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>What to do with Charlie in such a hurry, with
such a destination, would have been a troublesome
question if she had not by that time become
independent and able to support herself. It was not
that any gibbon-Romeo had found her out. That
happy fate had been impossible in the time
allowed. If, indeed, we had continued to dwell
there in the woods for another year or so, it was
the confident expectation of the neighbouring
gardeners that some enterprising young gibbon
would have recognised her charms, and appreciated
the combined advantages of freedom and plenty.
An official post, with abundance to eat and drink
and nothing to do, truly it was the very kind of
soft job that Mr Kipling’s heroes roam the world
to find. Yes, assuredly, the gardeners were right.
We would have had another civilised gibbon very
soon. Already somebody was considering on what
terms, as to housing and settlements, the managers
of the Rangoon Zoo might obtain the family.
But, like many another spinster, Charlie lost her
chance through no fault of her own. We could
not stay, and when suddenly the time came to go,
Charlie was ready. She had won her independence
differently.</p>

<p>It came about in this way. Our house was on
the edge of the town. There was nothing beyond
<a name="pg_267" id="pg_267" href="#pg_267"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>267<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it but some Buddhist temples and the rifle-range.
The way to both these places of resort was the
road by the side of which, among the trees, Charlie
finished her morning exercises, and sat watching
for my return, impatient for breakfast. So she
was soon noticed by the people, policemen,
volunteers or villagers, who were often passing
about that very time, and they never failed to stop
and watch her. Monkeys are not uncommon; but
a gibbon is a rare and popular sight on the plains
of Burma. Few of the passers-by had ever seen so
human a beast before, not even the Hindu policemen,
who hold monkeys in special honour.</p>

<p>Of all the tribes who have both arms and legs,
including ourselves, the gibbons appear to be,
proportionately, the strongest in the arms. Those
of Malaysia, in particular, called “agile” by
naturalists, are among the record leapers of the
world, clearing at a fling a space beyond the
capacity of perhaps any other being without
wings. Darwin and Wallace would explain this
by pointing out that they are the prey of animals
that lie in wait to catch them as they pass from
tree to tree, so that those of them who touched the
ground the least would be the most likely to
survive. The same tendencies are visible in Burma,
and though Charlie’s immediate kindred are not
<a name="pg_268" id="pg_268" href="#pg_268"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>268<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>such record-makers as her cousins in Malaysia,
they are fine performers, and so was she.</p>

<p>By slow degrees, not all at once, the little
acrobat in black velvet tights became aware of
the friendly attention of the observing crowds. It
was a visible addition to the pleasure of both sides
to be conscious of each other. The people began
to applaud. When they saw her enjoy their
applause, they applauded the more. She seemed
so like a prima donna or actress, that I have
never, since then, made the common mistake of
supposing the “little airs” of a woman on a public
scene to be affectation. Once, in particular, I was
watching her unobserved, when she seemed, in her
excitement, to have forgotten for the moment
breakfast and everything else. She was
apparently resting when first I caught sight of her, and
she did not see me. At any rate, she was sitting
with her back to the audience, looking over her
shoulder at intervals to make sure that they were
still waiting. Then she began to go bounding
round the tree. After a little of this, she went in
a corkscrew direction upwards, and when high
up flung herself to a neighbouring tree. The feat
was received with a burst of applause, in the midst
of which she went whirling round and came to
the top of the tree, and sat there, on the airiest
<a name="pg_269" id="pg_269" href="#pg_269"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>269<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pinnacle, surveying the admiring crowd with
complacency.</p>

<p>This happened oftener and oftener. When I
was transferred, all sorts of people offered to take
her. So, first, she went to see how she liked the
surroundings of the house of the Sergeant-Instructor
of the Volunteers. Her subsequent history was
reported <span class="nw">thus.—</span></p>

<p>The Sergeant’s house adjoined the barracks of
the Hindu (Sikh) policemen, who had been the
most appreciative of her many admirers; and
Charlie was not a chained monkey, but a free
woman, though a Lilliputian. It soon appeared
that she now needed more admiration than any
one man could give. She took less and less notice
of the Sergeant and his wife, and stayed more and
more in the trees beside the barracks, and at last
it was agreed that she was to be common property,
while all were there together, but that the Hindus
were to take her when they marched away. And
that was how Charlie became a camp-follower and
the pet of a battalion.</p>

<p>We next heard of her in 1897, when a native
officer called upon us at Toungoo, expressly
to give us news of her. She was then with her
battalion in Rangoon, and as popular as ever.
The details he gave have slipped from memory,
<a name="pg_270" id="pg_270" href="#pg_270"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>270<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>all but one, which he repeated in English,
addressing my wife: “Karlie” (so they pronounced
her name) “Karlie is now very fat.”</p>

<p>In later years I tried to find out more, but
failed. These little people do not live long.
There was a rumour that she died in 1905; and,
doubtless, she did die, her body returning to dust
and air, and her perplexed spirit, as her Hindu
friends, and indeed her old master too, would
agree to say, subsiding into the great ocean of
being that floods the world.</p>

 />THE BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF A LITTLE BEAR</h2>


<h3 title="1. Early Days">1. EARLY DAYS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">It</span> was in 1899 and in Upper Burma that two
little bears were brought, by villagers who
had caught them, to an officer still flourishing as
a magistrate in Burma, but averse to fame for
himself, though willing that his pets should have
their place in history. “They were at first no
bigger than that,” he said, as he held his hands
about a foot apart, “and I took a fancy to them
and decided to bring up both.”</p>

<p>It was as interesting as if they had been babies,
and easier. Indeed the bear has a certain primeval
claim upon us, having perhaps been humanity’s
oldest acquaintance. It is not a mere accident
that the Greeks made him a king of the woods
and sacred to Diana, and the Red Indians of
America made elaborate respectful speeches to
excuse themselves for eating him, as if it were a
<a name="pg_272" id="pg_272" href="#pg_272"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>272<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>kind of cannibalism. It can hardly be doubted
that men and bears became friends at first in
much the same way as men become friendly among
themselves at college and elsewhere, because they
chanced to be neighbours and of similar habits.
Nuts were nuts to bears and men, and fruits and
eggs were appreciated by both alike. For thousands
of years our arboreal ancestors and the bears must
have hobnobbed together, both finding it
awkward to have to be at home upon the trees and
yet move about upon the ground. Ah! how
we both did envy the birds! We have risen a
great deal in the world since then, and the bears
have been stationary, but we need not be proud.
While we watch the clumsy gait of the bear as
he brings his forelegs to the ground, if he has
far to go, and hobbles along, not very nimbly
perhaps, but better than we could go on all
fours, his very clumsiness should give us food for
thought. As he is now, so once were we, that
is to say, our ancestors, meaning our arboreal
ancestors, not long ago, that is to say, probably
less than a million years ago.</p>

<p>When he is young and only learning to walk,
his toes being turned in so as to suit his arboreal
movements, the bear trips on his own paws and at
times rolls over in a ludicrous way, as if turning
<a name="pg_273" id="pg_273" href="#pg_273"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>273<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>an unwilling somersault. After such a collapse,
his next impulse naturally is to move backwards,
as the safer way. But then, his eyes being set in
his head like our own, he soon finds that the
universe is too complex to allow indefinite blind
retrogression; and so he tries again, and makes
another cautious step or two forward, with a
continuous effort to avoid tripping on his own toes.
At last, though not without many a sad catastrophe,
he does learn to go forward and follow his
nose like other people. This is natural history,
an account of how a little bear learns to walk, and
it is not an allegory of the Russian empire, as
readers might suppose. That was how these two
little ones learned, while growing in size and in
favour with man and woman. They were in their
native climate, and too young as yet to see any
difference between humanity and themselves.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to watch them and share their
feelings, and escape for a moment from the
narrow limitations of <span class="nw">humanity.—</span></p>

<p>I have another friend, who has also been
foster-father to bears, and who is fond of
illustrating the distinction between instinct and reason
<a name="pg_274" id="pg_274" href="#pg_274"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>274<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>by their infantile habits. However small the cub,
he never needs to be taught how to bend and
arrange the twigs, so as to give himself a
convenient resting-place upon a branch. That, I am
told, is instinct; and so, I suppose, is licking his
paws, which comes as easy as breathing. But
once two baby bears were attracted by the smell
of honey to a wild bees’ nest up a tree. The
bees came out with angry buzz and stings. The
assailants were young, and had neither bee-hats
nor aprons, and they retired, discomfited. Their
kind master gave them, as consolation prize, some
spoonfuls of honey on a plate. They licked it all
up, and then looked at each other with surprise
and animation, as men do who are realising
something strange, as if saying to each other, and each
to himself, “So that was the meaning of the smell
we went to investigate.”</p>

<p>When the “brutality of instinct,” as the French
call it, was thus reinforced by knowledge, they did
not hesitate. “They did not pause to parley or
dissemble.” Straight back to the tree they went,
and up it, swiftly, steadily, right to the nest of the
bees, and tore it open, heedless of the stings,
brushing the bees aside as carelessly as if they
were flies. They guzzled the honey, and came
down slowly, licking their lips, only when it was
<a name="pg_275" id="pg_275" href="#pg_275"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>275<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>finished. Surely their foster-father might well
be proud of bears like these, and say that
they could draw inferences as well as an
undergraduate.</p>

<p>In case any reader is led by this history to
bring up a cub, let him remember to leave plenty
of water in his tub in the bathroom. It is sure to
be much appreciated in the hot weather. There
is no prettier sight than a little bear enjoying
himself in that way, with his two little hands—I
mean forepaws—hanging over different sides of
the tub, as he leans back. It should, however, be
remembered that, not being equal to the use of
towels, he likes to go to a bed and roll himself on
the bedding when he comes out of the water.
So unless there is someone standing by, there
should be a waterproof sheet over any accessible
bed.</p>

<p>These things are common to adolescent bears.
The uniformity of Nature is an old discovery, and
one of them is like another. As this is not a
treatise on Natural History but a biography of an
individual, I must restrict myself to what was
peculiar to our heroine and her companion, and
leave others to dilate upon what may be
generally seen in her fellow-creatures of the same
species.</p>

<h3 title="2. Up the Chimney">2. UP THE CHIMNEY
<a name="pg_276" id="pg_276" href="#pg_276"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>276<span class="ns">]</span></span></a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">In</span> writing as in living, it is easier to see what
is right than to do it. The biographers of
Europe would agree that their proper concern was
only what was characteristic of their heroes, and
not the details of human life in general. “In the
abstract,” they would all agree to this; yet which
of them does it? The difficulty is to discover
what is distinctive.</p>

<p>If that is hard for a man who is writing about
a man, it is still harder for the historian of a bear.
If I were a bear, I would not have been puzzled
to know whether the great adventure in the
chimney was a thing to tell, or only what any
bears would have done. Not being a bear, the
writer could not ask his inner consciousness. He
had to ask his friends who had bred bears; and
when he found that our heroine’s master was the
only one of them all who had a house with a
chimney, the problem had to be abandoned as
insoluble. So he has decided, like a certain great
author, to take the risk of being tedious rather
than elliptical.</p>

<p>The open-brick fireplace with a chimney was
for heating, not for cooking; and stood in the
<a name="pg_277" id="pg_277" href="#pg_277"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>277<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hall, near the front door. “I could never discover
why it was there,” said the unfortunate tenant of
the house. The building was an achievement of
the Public Works Department, which is
surrounded by mysteries and has ways past finding
out in Burma.</p>

<p>That fireplace and chimney perplexed the two
little bears as well as their master; and once,
when there was no fire, they sat down together on
the hearth, and meditated; and as they meditated
they lifted up their eyes and saw the sky! How
their hearts did burn within them, as they gazed
upon that light in darkness; and their instinctive
propensity to climb made them get up on their
hind legs and gape at each other, and rub their
eyes and look up again. Like the juvenile hero
of Longfellow, they felt the impulse of “Excelsior!”
Up they started, to reach that sky. At first, they
were quite composed—it seemed little harder
than going upstairs; and there was no hurry or
flurry. They helped each other. But a chimney
that grows narrower as you go up is disconcerting
to the aspiring climber without hands. It disturbs
the centre of gravity in an unusual way. They
fell back, first one and then the other, and again,
and again, and again; and ever, like the spider
whose persistence cheered the Bruce, they tried
<a name="pg_278" id="pg_278" href="#pg_278"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>278<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>again, and again, and again; and still they fell.
They became individualistic, but not all at once
desperate. There was a sublime fixity upon their
countenances, significant of the primeval elemental
forces which impelled them, yet nevertheless
pathetically human. After all, they were “seeking
the light,” be it remembered, honestly “seeking
the light.” Their blind impulsiveness made them
all the better symbols of humanity. Think of the
European scholastics in the Middle Ages. What
were <em>they</em> doing for many centuries but trying to
climb to the sky through a sooty chimney?</p>


<p class="tb"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>Smile if you will and must, but do not laugh.
You would have had no heart for laughing if you
had seen the agonies of the bears when strength
failed them, and their falls and bruises were—enough!
They flung themselves upon the ashes
of the hearth in a despair that was equal to that
of any man. From nose to tail they covered
themselves with ashes—to say nothing of the soot
already there.</p>

<p>However, as Byron sings, and psalmists and
fakirs have experienced, “the heart may break,
yet brokenly live on.” When they had had
enough of the ashes and the soot, they emerged;
and naturally, desiring above all things to be clean
<a name="pg_279" id="pg_279" href="#pg_279"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>279<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>again, they rubbed themselves upon the freshly
painted walls and nice clean furniture; and when
the servants ran to remonstrate, they made for the
bedrooms, amidst a general alleluia!</p>


<p class="tb"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>I abstained from asking their master what he
said when he came home; and he seemed to
appreciate my forbearance.</p>


<h3 title="3. At a Railway Station">3. AT A RAILWAY STATION</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">The</span> next remarkable incident was on a railway
journey, on the way to Ye-U. The guard
had charge of them, and kept them in their basket
in his own van, where he “could have an eye upon
them.” This would have been enough if they had
been common wild bears, newly caught; but these
were civilised animals, and while the guard kept
an eye upon them, they kept two pairs of eyes on
the guard.</p>

<p>It was a single line of railway, and there were
long pauses at every station, during which the
guard was on the platform. In one of these
intervals, the bears made a united effort, “with
a pull, and a push, and a push altogether,” and
then the shrieks of a stampeding crowd drew the
<a name="pg_280" id="pg_280" href="#pg_280"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>280<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>eyes of the guard and the station-master and everybody
else to the unusual sight of two fine young
bears enjoying a walk on the station platform.</p>

<p>The panic was not unreasonable. If they had
been wild young things, their own terror would
have made them dangerous. Fear is the cause
of cruelty, as Sir Charles Elliot (<cite>Odysseus</cite>) has
aptly remarked, in explaining the reciprocal
atrocities of Greeks and Turks. But the bright little
bears of this history had never known fear, secluded
as they were in a happy home. They only wanted
to stretch their legs, as other passengers were
doing. When that was seen, the shrieks of terror
turned to shrieks of laughter; and people made
reverent way for them, and followed them with
admiring looks, crowding respectfully, without
pressing close upon them, as if they had been
royalties or popular idols. The railway officials
were not teased by any more impatient questions
as to when that train would start. It must have
been more than a quarter of an hour after the
starting signals had been given, before anyone
thought of showing the bears and their admirers
the need of resuming their places and continuing
the journey.</p>

<p>The rest of the life of the bigger of the two, the
leader in this adventure, was short, and like the
<a name="pg_281" id="pg_281" href="#pg_281"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>281<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>records of common humanity, where “to be born
and die, of rich and poor makes all the history.”
He was wandering about with his chain loose, in
his master’s garden, and went up a tree. The
chain became entangled round his neck; and,
when next he was seen, it was the dead body of
a half-grown bear that was hanging from the end
of his chain. Nobody saw how it happened; but
there the beast was—dead!</p>


<h3 title="4. A Breakfast at Ye-U">4. A BREAKFAST AT YE-U</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">“Life</span> belongs to the living,” say the wise.
Whoever survives, must be prepared for
changes; and there is no misfortune so great that
a person of sense cannot draw some benefit from
it. That is true at times of bears, as well as of
men. For the surviving bear in this instance, the
sad death of her companion was not without a
pleasant result. She was delivered from her chain,
and rejoiced in her liberty, like a suffragette.
That is why the story of her life is interesting—and
short. Incidentally, it might be a lesson and
a warning to her sister-mortals in petticoats and
running loose; but, to be perfectly candid, that is
not why it is written. I do not wish to claim any
<a name="pg_282" id="pg_282" href="#pg_282"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>282<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>merit, undeserved. I tell her story just because I
liked it.</p>

<p>It is often a pleasure to remember sorrows
past, as Æneas reminded his shipwrecked
companions, by way of comforting them. But it
may be doubted whether our heroine ever took
much pleasure in the recollection of the breakfast
at Ye-U.</p>

<p>Three officers came to breakfast with her
master; and her usual place at table being filled,
she moved about, like a privileged child at a party,
suspecting no harm and intending none to any
living creature, when one of the men at table gave
her the end of a cigarette. She ate it. Whatever
else she scrutinised, she had always eaten without
hesitation whatever was offered by the hand of
man. So she swallowed the end of the cigarette,
and became very unhappy.</p>

<p>There may have been moral as well as physical
nausea. Who can read what passes in the brain
of a bear? Or feel what is in her heart? She may
have felt, in a dumb, instinctive way, what Schiller
has <span class="nw">articulated—</span></p>

<p>She went and lay near the wall of the dining-room,
with unconscious dignity averting her eyes
<a name="pg_283" id="pg_283" href="#pg_283"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>283<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>from the merry party, and making them laugh by
her look of patient helplessness, as she rubbed her
stomach with her two forepaws.</p>

<p>A pony was the next performer that morning.
The dining-room was on the level of the ground,
and the pony, running loose, came to the table as
usual for a tit-bit. “Send the beast away,” was
the impatient wish of a guest—let us hope he was
the hero of the cigarette. The host, who might
otherwise have gradually given some bits of fruit,
handed the happy quadruped a whole pineapple,
and bade him go away, intending thus to please
his guest and yet not disappoint his pony.
Pineapples are cheap in Burma. They are likewise
very juicy and good. The lucky pet, who also had
the easy confidence of a privileged person, began
to roll the big pineapple in his mouth, and was in
no haste to depart.</p>

<p>The mischief-maker, if it was he, as we hope,
made a gesture to quicken him; and the obedient
animal in turning raised his nose above the head
of the impatient man; and then there flowed down
upon the man a torrent of mingled froth and pineapple
juice, all churned together into a sticky milk.
He howled, and tried to dodge it, but was unlucky
in his movements. The only result was that he
received the torrent in two directions. While one
<a name="pg_284" id="pg_284" href="#pg_284"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>284<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>stream ran down his face, and anointed whatever
took the place of a beard, the other ran down the
back of his head and neck, even to the uttermost
skirts of his garments.</p>

<p>Then the bear was forgotten; and the other men
began to laugh at the man who sat under the pony.
They laughed the more when he lost his temper.
Even the host did laugh; and let us, who can
congratulate ourselves that we have never been guilty
of such a breach of courtesy, be candid enough to
consider—did we ever encounter such temptation?</p>

<p>What enhanced the fun, and his affliction, was
that instead of frankly facing the situation and
going to a bathroom, he tried to clean himself at
table. After exhausting the resources of civilisation
in the shape of handkerchiefs and napkins
and finger-bowls, he used towels—big bathroom
towels; and still he found purification as difficult
as ever did <span class="nw">Macbeth.—</span></p>

<p>But it was not a troubled conscience that dimmed
his eyes. His bodily eyes saw perfectly. The
trouble was the real adhesiveness of the mixture
saturating his garments and his skin. The
<a name="pg_285" id="pg_285" href="#pg_285"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>285<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>language of Macbeth, too, was refined in comparison
to his; for, as he glared at the laughers around
him, he said ... what I would not repeat, not
even in an affidavit.</p>

<p>Our heroine said nothing. <em>She</em> did not join in
the laughing. She was generally fond of fun; but
on this particular occasion, she seemed to be
completely self-absorbed, as sufferers are apt to be.
There are times when one craves to be alone.
She turned her face to the wall and her back to
the company.</p>


<h3 title="5. The Bear and the Perambulator">5. THE BEAR AND THE PERAMBULATOR</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Her</span> master loved her as dearly as ever any
man loved a dog; and so, when he was
transferred from the north of Upper to the south
of Lower Burma, he took her with him. This was
lucky for her. She had made a bad impression
on the man who came to relieve him, although, as
himself a father of children, he might have been
expected to appreciate her. It was all a
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>The new man had come in advance of his family,
but brought with him a perambulator, nicely
upholstered; and when the gentleman went upstairs to
<a name="pg_286" id="pg_286" href="#pg_286"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>286<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bed, and the servants to their quarters, our heroine
naturally proceeded to examine the perambulator,
which was exactly the right size for her. There
was nobody else in the house whom it suited at
all. How could she know, without being told,
of the impending arrival of another little thing?
Everything thereabouts had been at her disposal
hitherto. How could she suspect that this might
not be?</p>

<p>Of course she was too young to understand
distinctions of property; but, even if she
had had a mature human intellect, she might
easily have made the mistake she apparently
did.</p>

<p>At any rate, what is certain is that, next
morning, the fine leather was torn to tatters, and
the horse-hair spread about, while she contemplated
the work of her paws with complacency.
The new magistrate was as unable to express his
feelings as our heroine to explain her thoughts.
They gaped at each other, I believe. Presumably,
she had found the stuffing hot, and wished to make
her new toy suit the climate and her taste. But
she could not explain all that; and the new
magistrate <span class="nw">said....</span></p>

<p>Suffice it for the purpose of this history that he
made no objection when her own dear, original
<a name="pg_287" id="pg_287" href="#pg_287"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>287<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>master declared that he would take her with him
wherever he went. So they departed together.</p>


<p class="interjection"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span><small><i>P.S.</i>—While the biographer of the bear is correcting the
proofs of this book at Toungoo, Burma, in June, 1910, he
meets the owner of the perambulator, who not only confirms
what is here recorded, but even becomes bitter again against
the bear, and, warming at the recollection, rhapsodies in his
wrath.—“She was a wicked beast. She tore out the insides
of my pillows, too. She was eternally meddling. She
went everywhere. Nothing was sacred to her at all. I
never was gladder to see any pet begone.” “But did not
N. love her?” it was asked, naming her owner. “O yes,
he did, he thought nothing too good for her.” What a happy
little bear!</small></p>


<h3 title="6. Life in a Country Town">6. LIFE IN A COUNTRY TOWN</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">Their</span> destination was Kyauktan, a Burman
name that means a “ridge of rock.” As
you go up the river to Rangoon a low ridge is
visible, inland, on the right, almost parallel to the
muddy bank, and not very far from it. It is a
ridge of rock; but, in that benignant land, there
seems to be something indecent, or at least
savouring of skeletons, in bare rocks like those of
more desolate countries; and in this instance, as
usual there, you may know the rock is below, but
you see only the elevated greenery. Towards the
seaward end of the ridge is Kyauktan, a little
<a name="pg_288" id="pg_288" href="#pg_288"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>288<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>country town on a tidal creek, invisible from the
ocean steamers. There was the new home of our
happy heroine. There she lived in her master’s
house, amid abundance infinite to her, because she
could not measure it. Milk and rice she tolerated,
as other children do; but even of these she took
only what she wanted; and she had an
embarrassing choice of riches of other kinds, enough to
make any honey-bear quite happy.</p>

<p>The deep black of her fine fur was relieved by
beautiful white lines on her bosom, meeting in the
middle, like a necklace with a pendant on the
breast. As she squatted on her haunches her nose
was little above the edge of the table; but when
she stood up to help herself, as she was continually
doing, the natural decoration on her bosom was
conspicuous, and she almost seemed as if quite
nicely dressed.</p>

<p>Table manners she had none. How could she
have manners when she had no hands? The
word “manners” comes from the word for hand
(main, manus). Manners mean a dexterity that
hands make possible for men and monkeys, but
not for bears. If they had had the hands and we
their paws, the evolution of species would have
taken a different turn, and the course of the
world’s history changed indeed! Our heroine had
<a name="pg_289" id="pg_289" href="#pg_289"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>289<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to adapt herself, and did it with great dexterity,
but she could not grow hands. Her method at
table was to reach forth both her paws, and scoop
in towards herself whatever she wanted; and then
she would lift things to her lips with both paws,
using her nails almost as the Chinese do their
chopsticks. It was not her fault that she had to
break glasses and upset dishes and make many
a mess.</p>

<p>Her master could deny her nothing. It was
therefore lucky for him that her tastes were not
expensive. She liked fruits best, and the fresh
kinds too, which are cheap, not the tinned things.
But she was not bigoted. Her appetite was
eclectic. Sweet jam was appreciated, and honey
in a high degree; but she did not altogether
refuse marmalade if she saw nothing better.</p>

<p>Occasionally she was utterly unreasonable, and
became troublesome, not by pulling the tablecloth,
as did another Burman bear of my acquaintance,
but by a peculiarity equally characteristic of a pet
that was spoiled. Or it might be attributed to her
temperament. It consisted in being so absorbed
in what she saw that she forgot everything else,
just like the ordinary doctrinaire or idealist or
athlete or any other kind of common person, able
to see only one thing at a time. For example, if
<a name="pg_290" id="pg_290" href="#pg_290"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>290<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>she saw plantains on the table, and wanted them,
but did not then want any of the milk or sugar or
other things intervening, she ignored what she did
not want, and leaned over far enough to include
the plantains in her magnificent embrace, and
pulled the plantains to her, unheeding all the rest.</p>

<p>No man is perfect. Her master has confessed
that he once or twice was so provoked at such a
performance as to give her a tap on the nose,
whereupon she went and “sulked in a corner,” as
he expressed it; but how could he tell what she
was thinking?</p>

<p>Some said she whimpered for her mother on
such occasions. The Burmans say, “When the
child trips, it cries for its mother”; but it is not
certain that she remembered her early days, for
she was but a young thing when she was caught
and taken to a man’s house. Her master may
well have been an indifferent substitute for an
indulgent parent; but he was all she had, and his
jam was very good.</p>

<p>He was not allowed to monopolise her young
affections. She had not been long in Kyauktan
before she had explored the town and even found
her way to the bazaar or market, where the
stall-holders, male and female, welcomed her with open
arms.</p>

<p><a name="pg_291" id="pg_291" href="#pg_291"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>291<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>To tell Europeans of a bear running about loose
and being welcomed with open arms in the markets
may seem a fairy tale; and though in a narrative
of fact it is permissible to tell what is stranger
than fiction, still it may be as well to explain a
few things that Europeans cannot easily know.
The Kyauktan bazaar was a <em>retail</em> market, where
people were never in a hurry, quite different from
Covent Garden; and the bears of Burma have
different habits from those of Europe. They
are smaller too; but that is the least of the
difference.</p>

<p>In Europe, if we mean to be rude and impute
rudeness, we call a man a bear. To torture bears
was a familiar sport, not long ago—bear-baiting.
We still use the word; and big bears ignominiously
led captive may still be seen, bemocked to make
a foolish holiday. All this implies a hostile
attitude which is never seen in Burma.</p>

<p>Perhaps a grim passage in Gibbon’s <cite>History</cite>
may be quoted to show the contrast. It is in
chapter xxv, and concerns the great Emperor
Valentinian (<span class="allsc">A.D.</span> 364–375). He had put his
brother Valens on the throne at Constantinople,
and taken charge of the rowdier end of the world
himself.</p>

<p>“In the government of his household, or of his
<a name="pg_292" id="pg_292" href="#pg_292"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>292<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>empire, slight, or even imaginary offences, a hasty
word, a casual omission, an involuntary delay,
were chastised by a sentence of immediate death.
The expressions which issued the most readily
from the mouth of the emperor of the West were,
‘Strike off his head’; ‘Burn him alive’; ‘Let
him be beaten with clubs till he expires’; and his
most favoured ministers soon understood that, by
a rash attempt to dispute or suspend the execution
of his sanguinary commands, they might
involve themselves in the guilt and punishment of
disobedience. The repeated gratification of this
savage justice hardened the mind of Valentinian
against pity and remorse; and the sallies of
passion were confirmed by the habits of cruelty.
He could behold with calm satisfaction the
convulsive agonies of torture and death: he reserved
his friendship for those faithful servants whose
temper was the most congenial to his own. The
merit of Maximin, who had slaughtered the noblest
families of Rome, was rewarded with the royal
approbation and the prefecture of Gaul. Two
fierce and enormous bears, distinguished by the
appellations of <cite>Innocence</cite> and Mica Aurea, could
alone deserve to share the favour of Maximin.
The cages of those trusty guards were always
placed near the bedchamber of Valentinian, who
<a name="pg_293" id="pg_293" href="#pg_293"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>293<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>frequently amused his eyes with the grateful
spectacle of seeing them tear and devour the
bleeding limbs of the malefactors who were
abandoned to their rage. Their diet and exercises
were carefully inspected by the Roman emperor;
and, when <cite>Innocence</cite> had earned her discharge by
a long course of meritorious service, the faithful
animal was again restored to the freedom of her
native woods.”</p>

<p>Unlike those occidental savages, the heroine of
our history, if asked to eat the flesh of men or
even butchers’ meat, would have felt as much
insulted as Bernard Shaw himself. I do not
mean that either she or “the Shaw” would rather
starve than nibble a chicken; but that their
tastes were delicate, and they preferred cereals
and vegetables and fruits and sweets to any kind
of carcasses.</p>

<p>The Burmans call the bear “wetwun,” the
governor or minister of the pigs, the “gentleman
pig”; and sometimes say, between jest and
earnest, that pigs and bears are good Buddhists.
That is because they are not murderous, though
strong. It is only in self-defence that they ever
do hurt. They live in general without taking life;
and a nice she-bear that was sleek and tame was
a treat to see, especially as she was not proud, the
<a name="pg_294" id="pg_294" href="#pg_294"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>294<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>unpardonable sin in Mongolian eyes. She was
ever willing to accept little tit-bits of fruit and to
stand and be caressed by anybody.</p>

<p>The woods were near. No doubt she often
lifted up her eyes in that direction; but the sweet
things of the table and the excitements of the
bazaar—all the comforts of Charing Cross, so to
speak—kept her from trying to escape.</p>

<p>I once knew a pet that did run away, and after
some days’ absence came back again; but in this
instance, the bear did not worry her master in that
way. Servants are not partial to pets. She could
go wherever she liked, and perhaps they would
not have been sorry if she had departed altogether.
But she always came back. Perhaps it was
because she could escape at any time, as easily
to-morrow as to-day. There was no hurry. She
may have intended to go off to the woods at some
time or other, and always postponed it. As
Goethe admirably says, “We love to walk along
the plains, with the summit in our eye.”</p>

<p>Whatever her feelings or thoughts, when she
took her walks abroad, that is to say, outside her
master’s little park or compound, she generally
went to the bazaar.</p>

<h3 title="7. The Wonderful Suckling">7. THE WONDERFUL SUCKLING
<a name="pg_295" id="pg_295" href="#pg_295"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">One</span> of the most amusing of European ways
in Burma and India is the habit of adhering
to hours of work and fashions of garments that
suit London. In the heat of the day the whites
and their direct employees are supposed to be
working hard. This leaves the best hours of the
twenty-four for amusement, which is not exactly
what was intended. The fashion is set by men
who live in the hills. That is the secret.</p>

<p>You cannot really ignore the sun in the Tropics,
however; you can only pretend to do it. Go into
many a native quarter or bazaar in the middle of
the day, as the bear used to do at Kyauktan, and
you behold life honestly relaxed. The customers
in the bazaar are country cousins from a distance,
if there are any customers. The buzz of an
occasional sewing-machine is like the drone of
bees in summer, harmonious enough in the ears
of the bazaar-sellers, many of whom are taking a
siesta.</p>

<p>When she wanted fun or fruit or to see the
crowd—when she was on business, so to speak—the
bear went to the bazaar like other Kyauktan
people, in the morning, or perhaps the late
<a name="pg_296" id="pg_296" href="#pg_296"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>296<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>afternoon. When she went in the middle of the day,
it was just because master was busy at court and
it was dull at home, and a rest seemed likely to
be more enjoyable in company.</p>

<p>When once she was sauntering towards it at
this mid-day hour, she passed an Indian cottage,
in front of which, upon a “charpoy” or bedstead,
used also as a couch, and now set upon the ground
in a shady spot, a young Indian mother lay sound
asleep, with baby in her lap, it may be guessed.
At any rate the baby had had enough for the
time, while mamma lay back upon the couch,
breathing peacefully. Her plump and healthy
breasts were full of milk; and as the little bearess
looked, the instinct of childhood returned upon
her, and she went up softly and laid her lips to
the nipple which the other baby had abandoned.
“She milked the woman dry,” said people afterwards;
but nobody saw it being done. Nobody
noticed anything till the street rang with female
shrieks. “Ayāh! Ayāh! Ayāh! Mother!
mother! Help, help! Come, all! Come, all!
Come! Come! Come, all! Come, all! Help!
help! Ah, mother, mother, mother, mother!
Ayāh! Ayāh!” The bear pushed her way
through the gathering crowd and hurried home
unhurt. One does not readily lift a hand against
<a name="pg_297" id="pg_297" href="#pg_297"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>297<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>an old favourite; and she was home before people
realised the terrible event.</p>

<p>Luckily for everybody, Kyauktan was, and still
is, blessed with that most useful of men—an honest
lawyer. He was a barrister-at-law; but the queer
convention of some parts of Europe, which
restricts the best lawyers to talking in court, and
allows them to be consulted only through another
lawyer, is as unknown in Burma as in America.
At Kyauktan, as in Boston, you do <em>not</em> need
to be “lathered in one shop and shaved in
another.” You choose your lawyer, and go to
him, straight.</p>

<p>The Kyauktan barrister had been an official
once; but, as people said, he had retired and
reformed. In sober truth, he had been one of the
best Commissioners ever known in Burma; and
now his mere presence at Kyauktan made life
more bearable to honest men, for many miles
around.</p>

<p>To him the husband of the unhappy young
mother, just milked dry, went running, a score of
women probably shrieking instructions after him,
and half the women in Kyauktan standing ready to
advise. But, wonderful to tell, there were many of
them on the side of the bear, poor harmless orphan;
and when, after a while, the obedient husband
<a name="pg_298" id="pg_298" href="#pg_298"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>298<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>slowly returned to his wife, and did not announce
a suit or anything else to be done, some praised
the lawyer, and others said that the man had only
pretended to go and consult him. The strangest
thing of all, significant of much, was that nobody
then complained to the bear’s master or even told
him of the matter. He was left to learn it later
from the bantering of the honest lawyer. Was
there ever a pet so popular before?</p>


<h3 title="8. Harum-Scarum">8. HARUM-SCARUM</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">There</span> were many other freaks of the bear
which a kind conspiracy of silence
concealed from her master as long as possible. Like
other bachelors who live alone, he was not always
punctual in sitting down to table. His pet had
the healthy appetite of youth, and was hungry at
times before dinner was ready, and then, being at
home everywhere and not troubled with false
pride, she naturally went to the kitchen and
helped herself.</p>

<p>It is likely that she burned or scalded herself in
that way, for it is known that another little
Burman bear, who frequented the kitchen, had
that experience. But we have only probability to
go upon in this instance. She made no
<a name="pg_299" id="pg_299" href="#pg_299"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>299<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>complaints, and returned regularly, and the cook
would not tell tales. Indeed, he seems to have
taken great pains to protect her, thrusting himself
between her and danger so often that, at last, not
knowing what he would be at, she either misunderstood
his intentions or lost patience, and recollecting
how strong she was, she turned to claw that
affectionate but too meddlesome cook.</p>

<p>The upshot was all her master was allowed to
know. It could not be concealed. The cook had
to bolt. Alone in the kitchen, with unfettered
discretion, she behaved like the reasonable,
civilised animal she was. She merely took what
she wanted and did what she liked, and allowed
the cook to return. She had never meant to hurt
him, only to remove him out of her way.</p>

<p>She used to travel about with her master, when
he went on tour. Being unable to ride a pony,
she sat in a cart. The ideal method would have
been for her to sit in a box or basket on such
occasions, and journey as Gulliver did in
Brobdingnag; but it was useless to argue with her.
She could burst any wickerwork, as easily as
Samson burst his bonds, and she saw no need for
anything but a convenient seat. She liked to joke
with the driver, like a passenger on an
old-fashioned bus or coach; but gradually it came to
<a name="pg_300" id="pg_300" href="#pg_300"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>300<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>her master’s knowledge that, only too often, the
driver and anybody else in the cart had to jump
down to avoid her—she was so rough in her
horseplay. There was a rumour that she once
knocked down a driver; but he made no
complaint and it was probably an accident. I was
once nearly knocked down by a bear that cannoned
against me by inadvertence, hurrying to greet me
in a friendly way.</p>

<p>When left alone in the cart, she never attempted
to touch the reins. She gazed at them and the
bullocks, serenely unconcerned, as the passengers
in a steamer look at the machinery. When the
driver went to the bullocks’ heads and stopped
them, and gathered up the reins and climbed back
into the cart, she seemed to consider his behaviour
a matter of course, and looked as if anything else
would have surprised her. Nevertheless, when
these transporting adventures became known, her
master insisted on leaving her at home.</p>


<h3 title="9. All the Rest">9. ALL THE REST</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">It</span> was not altogether disagreeable to the bear
to be left alone in the house, with only a
servant or two, and nobody to correct her; but
<a name="pg_301" id="pg_301" href="#pg_301"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>301<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>she made herself unpleasant to other people. Her
master found her, after every absence, “more and
more savage” upon his return. These are his
own words; and yet, and yet, however imperious
to others or contemptuous of humanity, she was
always amenable to him, and to him she was
always dear.</p>

<p>At this point, as is common in biographies, the
historian who would be faithful must face a divided
duty. In order to please the friends and relatives,
one has to heed nothing but what they choose
to tell; and if one does that, then the biography
is merely an unreadable fiction. As a satirist
cynically puts <span class="nw">it,—</span></p>

<p>One of the things that make this biography worth
writing is the freedom from conventional restraints.
So readers shall have the truth, and the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth. The bear’s
master has long been a friend of mine, and I hope
will so continue, but truth is dearer than anybody.
So I will not suppress the remarks of the honest
lawyer at Kyauktan, who is also an old friend, and
has read the first draft of this work. He sent me
<a name="pg_302" id="pg_302" href="#pg_302"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>302<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a letter on the subject, containing the excruciating
words that the bear at Kyauktan had become “a
nuisance.” The expression is his. My responsibility
is limited to quoting it. I desire to express
no opinion of my own.</p>

<p>What her own master could not help seeing was
the contrast between her behaviour and that of a
very respectable bear at Syriam, a place at the
other end of the ridge, nearly a day’s walk from
Kyauktan, just across the river from Rangoon.
The bear living there belonged to Mr Brand of the
Burma Oil Company, and he and our heroine’s
master often compared notes, and discussed the
problem of her higher education. Mr Brand
seemed to think she had good natural gifts, but
had come to a difficult age when she needed <em>daily</em>
supervision. He never went on tour himself, and
was willing to take charge of her. She would be
sure to benefit by the company of an older and
well-behaved bear, and the two together would be
happier at Syriam than either was alone. At last
her owner was persuaded, and, when every
preliminary had been settled, our heroine set out for
her new home (<span class="allsc">A.D.</span> 1900).</p>

<p>She went in a slow cart, and the day was hot.
It is not so well known as it should be that bears
and elephants and tigers, too, are almost as
<a name="pg_303" id="pg_303" href="#pg_303"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>303<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sensitive to the sunshine as white men. In this
instance, though every possible precaution was
taken, the bear was decidedly unhappy on the
way. We have to remember that she was an
adolescent female and a fully emancipated one,
who had lived exclusively for her own amusement,
and never had anything particular to do or to
suffer in this world. Her sensations, therefore,
must have been remarkably like those of the
American family, immortalised in Ruskin’s letter
to Norton of 1869.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I ... was fated to come from Venice to
Verona with an American family, father and
mother and two girls—presumably rich—girls
15 and 18. I never before conceived the misery
of wretches who had spent all their lives in trying
to gratify themselves. It was a little warm—warmer
than was entirely luxurious—but nothing
in the least harmful. They moaned and fidgeted
and frowned and puffed and stretched and fanned,
and ate lemons, and smelt bottles, and covered
their faces, and tore the cover off again, and had
no one thought or feeling, during five hours of
travelling in the most noble part of all the world,
except what four poor beasts would have had in
their den in a menagerie, being dragged about on
<a name="pg_304" id="pg_304" href="#pg_304"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>304<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a hot day....” (<cite>Letters of John Ruskin to C. E. Norton</cite>,
I, pp. 218 and 219.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The longest road has an end, and Syriam
was reached at last. The cart stopped, and
the bear came down from it with every sensation
smothered in one irresistible craving for
coolness “Anything to be cool!” A pleasant-looking
tank of water was near, and into it she
plunged.</p>

<p>The details of what followed are variously
reported. Eyes she had and ears of the best;
but she used them to avoid people. It was
only after a long time that it pleased her
to emerge, quite shivering now, cool enough at
last.</p>

<p>Fever came on and pneumonia; and, next day
she died, and that is the end of the story. When
you think of it, that is how every story would end
if it went on long enough.</p>


<h3 title="10. Her Epitaph">10. HER EPITAPH</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uc">It</span> is now 1910: and already Mr Brand himself
is dead; and, spinning in the official whirligig,
“like the wind’s blast, never resting, homeless,”

 </span></span></a>the bear’s old master has long ago left Kyauktan,
and been in many places. So it is natural that no
monument has been put up to her memory; and,
maybe, none ever will be. But the things of the
spirit are so wonderfully made that words on
paper may endure longer than marble or brass;
wherefore, though it has not been engraved, let
her epitaph be printed. If it is remembered till
there is another as long and equally free from
falsehood, it may endure for centuries; and, in the
far forward dark abysms of time, this little bear
may be associated with the constellation of that
name, the constellation containing the Polar star.
Far stranger things have happened in this wonderful
world.</p>

<p>In the classical texts, these ancient hunting-songs
appear as here translated; but in singing
them, if there is time to spare, the first may well
be sung <em>after</em> the second as well as before it. It
is at once a fit introduction and a fit conclusion.</p>

<p>These two songs are taken from a collection of
<cite>Chinese Songs and Sayings</cite>, not published yet, and
put here to show a kind of tiger-killing deserving
as much honour as men can ever give a fellow-man.</p>

<p>In those days hunting was more like work than
sport, and tigers were still a menace to humanity,
such as we can hardly now conceive. There was
great merit in hindering a tiger from escaping
then; but to-day that matters little. Such an
event as the song describes is not uncommon still.
I have heard credibly of about a dozen like
it among contemporaries in Burma in the last
twenty-four years. Men seeking deer or other
<a name="pg_310" id="pg_310" href="#pg_310"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>310<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>game are suddenly confronted by a tiger similarly
engaged. If the men make way for him, he
merely shows his teeth and swiftly escapes, and
that is what generally happens. But if any one of
the hunters hurts him, or his road seems blocked,
then there is danger; and that is how fatal
accidents often happen.</p>

<p>Something of that sort was probably impending
on this occasion, 740 <span class="allsc">B.C.</span>, or about then. There
was probably a big crowd and a desperate tiger,
and while the others facing him were shrinking,
Shuh perhaps leaped from his chariot, certainly
stepped to the front, ready for action, a stalwart
Chinese figure, stripped to the waist, like Nelson’s
sailors on a day of battle, and in all likelihood a
big-pointed knife in his hand. A shout might
make the tiger shy a second, and so give him a
chance; but the likeliest thing is that the tiger,
coming out of the darkness into the glare of the
fires, did not see him, and perhaps was trying to
get away, or charging some other person, so that
Shuh could take him sideways and kill him.
Somehow or other, Shuh did it. Think of the few
thrilling seconds of glorious life, and the jubilation
of the crowd when the knife went home.</p>

<p>Note the difference between them and us. Miss
your shot with the breechloader, and you can fire
<a name="pg_311" id="pg_311" href="#pg_311"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>311<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>again, and even if you do not hit a vital part, you
can stop him. “But with bow and arrows,” as an
old man said to me in 1889, telling how he and his
father had fought a tiger with such weapons, and
showing me the good old cross-bow they used, “it
is folly to shoot till he is close, for at a distance
the arrow merely irritates him. Wait till he is
near.”</p>

<p>“Ten yards?”</p>

<p>“My father, let him come nearer. Then you hit
his brain through the eye, if he’s coming straight,
or the heart through the ribs, if he shows his side,
and so he is dead.”</p>

<p>“But if he isn’t dead?”</p>

<p>“Then drop your bow, and fight him with the
knife. Never try a second shot, for, if you do, he’s
sure to get you. The tiger is very, <em>very</em> quick.
You have to dodge him and get a knife into his
vitals before he grips you.”</p>

<p>I suggested a spear; but was told it was too
clumsy and slow to be a good weapon.</p>

<p>The words of that old veteran, living among the
hills between Burma and China, seemed to me to
illuminate the hunting scene in old Honan better
than any of the commentators on the Classics.
But for his talk, one would have been slow to
guess that Shuh went close to the tiger with a
<a name="pg_312" id="pg_312" href="#pg_312"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>312<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>knife. That would explain why the poet alluded
to Shuh’s bare arms, and to his standing in the
front. He could not have fired arrows from his
chariot, for the horses would have bolted. So we
may still see him through so many centuries, afoot
and in front, with business-like bare arms and
sharp knife ready; we can rejoice with them all,
and admire him yet, and feel also, with the singers,
“once like that for life will do.” It comes like a
shock to remember that we are among the shades,
and that more than fifty or sixty generations of
men have come and gone since Shuh and his
companions all melted into dust and air.</p>

<p>It gives us another kind of shock to contrast that
kind of work with modern hunting. Our statesmen
at large, slaughtering in foreign woods, are
neither better nor worse than their friends at home,
“the poulterers.” The only serious danger is from
their own awkwardness in handling guns. Their
butcheries are like those in old Roman arenas;
and even Theodore Roosevelt himself, returning in
gory glory but without a scratch from Africa, can
only be compared by one of his admirers to the
immortal Tartarin of Tarascon.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
